They want safe roads not traffic jams. https://t.co/z0LGnXAnw1 In their so-called ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù bill, Democrat politicians have put political activists ahead of blue-collar workers again. Only one out of every twenty dollars of the spending spree would go to roads and bridges. https://t.co/fRjcjVdzic Americans want improvement in REAL infrastructure. They don‚Äôt want their taxes raised for unnecessary liberal spending. .@JoeBiden‚Äôs Infrastructure Bill is the #GreenNewDeal in disguise. There is more funding for electric vehicles than for roads, bridges, ports, airports, and waterways combined. https://t.co/RDnSpdfFBc Until we finish the wall and bring back the #RemainInMexico policy, Border Patrol agents‚Äô jobs are only going to get harder. @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris must go to the border and face the facts. More children are now in Border Patrol custody than ever before. Two-thirds of Border Patrol agents can‚Äôt do their jobs because they are stuck babysitting children. https://t.co/HVCwIJ1c3y This multi-trillion dollar waste of taxpayer funds is the biggest bait and switch since President Obama announced his ‚Äúshovel-ready‚Äù stimulus. After all these years, President Biden has found something to shovel, the problem for the American people is he is shoveling malarkey. The Biden Administration claims that its plan will help support existing public transit trains in Wyoming. There are no public transportation trains in Wyoming. The president says he is a ‚Äúno malarkey‚Äù guy‚Ä¶ this is a malarkey plan. https://t.co/P5FaF4cZ6n #TheMalarkeyPlan https://t.co/MQYCTrLYB6 The Lincoln County Public Health staff &amp; volunteers are doing a phenomenal job vaccinating folks at the clinic in Afton. Thanks to #Covid19 vaccine clinics like this one &amp; others like it around the state, Wyoming is one step closer to getting back to normal. https://t.co/wJMK0sZ5dL The Biden administration created this crisis, and now President Biden must fix it. #BidenBorderCrisis https://t.co/pFbfrGe8BJ The Cody Rotary Club previewed the upcoming Yellowstone Songwriter Festival during their weekly meeting today.

The vaccine is now available for anyone over the age of 16 in Wyoming. https://t.co/iiqGCwrFiB Border security is national security. @JoeBiden‚Äôs immigration positions have made our country more vulnerable to terrorists. Border Patrol agents want to finish the wall and reinstate Trump‚Äôs #RemainInMexico policy because these policies were effective at protecting our country. https://t.co/59Syqt02l3 Americans want affordable, reliable, and safe energy.

Stopped by their local vaccine clinic today to thank the hardworking volunteers &amp; health care professionals working to help protect people &amp; end this pandemic. https://t.co/LZqzhPist2 Democrats are offering to hamstring the economy with higher energy bills &amp; higher taxes for families in Wyoming &amp; across America. Pres Biden should change course &amp; look to our bipartisan highway bill from last Congress if he is really interested in improving our #infrastructure. The tax-and-spend Democrats are back. The plan Pres. Biden unveiled today is an out-of-control socialist spending spree. This proposal starts with the punishing policies of the #GreenNewDeal &amp; builds back worse from there. https://t.co/0anfALJ5UW The #GrizzlyBear is fully recovered in Wyoming. The Biden admin's @USFWS missed an opportunity today to celebrate this success &amp; remove the bear from the Endangered Species List. It‚Äôs time for Wyoming, not Washington, to be in charge of managing the bear. https://t.co/ciahBo3UnA The dedicated students and staff at Laramie‚Äôs Slade Elementary set the bar for education excellence in #Wyoming. Students at this 2020 @NatlBlueRibbon school are thoughtful, positive, and ready to achieve great things in life. https://t.co/t0zCwTYwDW Emma Howell Knight was the 1st Dean of Women #UWYO in 1918.

She was an outstanding WY woman. #WomensHistoryMonth Photo credit: @ahcwyo https://t.co/VN8NmHrUX7 Biden‚Äôs #Infrastructure Plan is a Trojan horse for more liberal spending &amp; higher taxes. Republicans want to work on highways, roads, &amp; bridges that already have bipartisan support. Democrats want to include free community college &amp; the punishing regulations of the #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/ngFeKRkvfc The Biden admin is moving toward giving all illegal immigrants citizenship. To solve the #BidenBorderCrisis we need to listen to #BorderPatrol agents and reinstitute the Remain in Mexico policy that @JoeBiden removed on Day 1 in office. https://t.co/t13q7wuCC4 Pinedale Elementary School‚Äôs 3rd through 5th grade students are wise beyond their years. They asked some really smart questions on everything from studying medicine, to how government works and the pandemic.

It was wonderful to visit both the House and Senate while in Cheyenne today. https://t.co/8nDoHcgSHx The #BidenBorderCrisis is a double crisis. It‚Äôs a humanitarian crisis as well as a national security crisis. The Biden admin doesn‚Äôt want people to see the images that we were able to take videos of on our trip to the border. https://t.co/IfOn8UkCdu On our visit to the border, we saw firsthand the overwhelming challenges &amp; humanitarian crisis our border agents are up against as a result of the Biden admin‚Äôs policies. Time for @JoeBiden to stop censoring &amp; allow media in so Americans can see what a tragedy this really is. https://t.co/IaFHinUsTB Pres. @JoeBiden must finish the wall. Walls work. https://t.co/RVpMMpdNkF We know that the border wall works. Instead of finishing it, the Biden administration stopped the construction of the wall. Now the unfinished area and gaps are serving as a conduit for people to come in illegally and stay. #BidenBorderCrisis https://t.co/7JqG2qTVTj Thanks to local and city officials in Texas for briefing @SenateGOP on the escalating crisis at the border. #BidenBorderCrisis https://t.co/TaSA5Eplih I was at the Donna processing facility earlier today. It‚Äôs extremely overcrowded - no place for children. It highlights how out of hand the #BidenBorderCrisis really is. Pres. Biden needs to end this crisis now and stop giving people incentives to come here illegally. https://t.co/aAKsO0VBNj Went on a midnight patrol on the Texas/Mexico border with US Border Patrol agents last night to see the #BidenBorderCrisis and smugglers firsthand. We‚Äôre so grateful for our Border Patrol agents for everything they do to keep us safe. https://t.co/hT5EXg7sAV Congrats to the people of Greece as they celebrate their 200th #GreekIndependenceDay. From the beginning of Greece‚Äôs struggle for independence, Americans supported &amp; fought alongside them. Together, our nations continue to strive to advance the principles of freedom &amp; democracy. Wyoming is fighting back against @POTUS‚Äô war on American energy workers. @GovernorGordon is taking action to combat the Biden administration‚Äôs illegal ban on oil and gas lease sales on federal land. https://t.co/cciurIWIVO Cosponsored a bipartisan bill led by @SenatorRisch &amp; @SenAngusKing to provide America‚Äôs sportsmen &amp; women with easily accessible digital maps &amp; information.

The American people should be able to see for themselves the crisis that the Biden admin‚Äôs policies have created. #BidenBorderCrisis https://t.co/yDdDcd0wvs The Biden administration has caused this border crisis, and is trying to cover up the true level of its severity. Republicans have solutions that can immediately reverse the effects of President Biden‚Äôs actions. https://t.co/ZRKf3fRwHD Senate Democrats just blocked @SenTomCotton‚Äôs and my bill that would prevent harmful cuts to #Medicare. Instead of working with Republicans to protect America‚Äôs seniors, Democrats would rather give American taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants or prisoners. https://t.co/uDefJBdZp0 There is a crisis at the border‚Äîthe numbers tell the story. This is @JoeBiden‚Äôs crisis, created by his policies. He essentially put out the welcome mat and turned on the sign that said our borders are open. https://t.co/SdP5aIiiSA Democrats previously worked with Republicans to provide critical relief from the 2 percent Medicare sequester. Not this time. The right thing to do now is to take a portion of the funding already appropriated and give it to a high-priority need in our communities. Introduced a bill with @SenTomCotton to stave off looming Medicare cuts by redirecting a portion of the Democrats‚Äô $1.9 spending bill. Instead of experiencing automatic cuts, the hardest-hit providers would receive targeted relief. https://t.co/bAouCIzYiV This crisis will not fix itself. We need to take action. Republicans have a series of commonsense solutions to improve the situation immediately. President Biden has already shown himself to be the most open-borders president in American history. In February alone, federal agents apprehended more than 100,000 illegal immigrants crossing our southern border. That‚Äôs more than double the number from last February. https://t.co/Qrm7VE8zO8 Let‚Äôs go, cowgirls! #GoWyo #OneWyoming #ncaaW https://t.co/aQfMfbNwIH I‚Äôll be at the border with @SenTedCruz on Friday to see this crisis for myself.

‚Ä¢Finish the wall https://t.co/tBLP9sGgf7 During this pandemic, we need a leader for the Department of Health &amp; Human Services who brings us together as a nation.

Instead of using all available energy options, the @WorldBank would rather score political points by boycotting critical coal, oil &amp; gas projects. Her views on American energy fly in the face of the mission of the @Interior. I oppose her nomination &amp; will continue to fight to protect America‚Äôs energy workers and energy dominance. https://t.co/4jpABFibL4 Representative Haaland‚Äôs extreme policy views, lack of substantive answers during the confirmation process, and full support for @POTUS‚Äô war on American energy disqualify her for the job of @Interior secretary. There is a CRISIS at our southern border.

And Joe Biden's White House is only making it WORSE.

These are the facts. https://t.co/OP12kmWFw6 I‚Äôd really like to see bipartisanship on infrastructure. @SenSanders &amp; I both supported a bipartisan highway bill last Congress, but the House replaced it with #GreenNewDeal. Even @PeteButtigieg thought our Senate bill would have been the way to move forward. https://t.co/7MpYJ6PuHE Democrats‚Äô #COVID relief bill is false advertising as little of the money in it actually goes to ending #coronavirus.

It‚Äôs a well deserved grade because he promised to have schools open all across America within 100 days. He's failed. Instead, he got in line behind teachers' unions. https://t.co/EQSuRBiTSm Rep.

What has happened to Duante Wright &amp; Caron Nazario would never have happened to me or my daughters. 

We need to confront that real inequality as a country. #BlackLivesMatter The enhanced Child Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan is a historic step forward.

It will make a massive difference in the lives of kids and families like Robyn's ‚Äî who I heard from on Friday ‚Äî in Colorado and across the country.

We now have to make these changes permanent. https://t.co/ltRDzPXHiq This #BlackMaternalHealthWeek reminds us of America's shameful maternal mortality rate and its devastating effect on Black women. Earlier this year, I joined @SenBooker in introducing legislation to tackle this crisis and help ensure every mom has access to the care they deserve. If we make the Child Tax Credit expansion permanent, it will transform the lives of millions of kids and families across this country. 
 
Thank you to @SpeakerPelosi for her strong leadership in pushing to make this a reality. https://t.co/fF9XdvFrXp This week, I stopped by a veteran vaccination clinic in Colorado to see how vaccination distribution is progressing.

By investing in families through the American Rescue Plan and its tax credit expansions, we will bridge the gap from this crisis to an economy that works for everyone. https://t.co/h01DlV5Sky The American Rescue Plan included a much-needed investment in our public health workforce infrastructure, based on a bill @SenGillibrand &amp; I introduced to establish a Health Force.

#AmericanJobsPlan https://t.co/CBFv8xBtq6 Had a great discussion with housing resource providers in the Grand Valley today about how the American Rescue Plan and its expanded tax credits will support housing needs. This continues to be a challenge across our state, and I'll keep pushing for support at the federal level. https://t.co/KXbMX1jC5j Great to meet with Director Richard Salgueiro and other leaders of the Veterans Affairs Western Colorado Health Care System today. I understand that veterans living in rural Colorado face unique challenges, and I look forward to working with the VA to address their concerns. https://t.co/7UJymJgT8k The more Coloradans who #GetVaccinated, the closer we get to putting this pandemic behind us.
 
As distribution progresses, we must continue to be vigilant, social distance, and wear a mask.
 
We'll get through this together, Colorado. On this solemn day, we should remember that Dr. King worked his entire life to make America more just, more fair, more free.  
 
Each of us should ask ourselves, ""What are we contributing to this same cause?"" You can draw a straight line between higher #COVID19 rates among communities of color and disparities in access to quality health care.

#NationalMinorityHealthMonth serves as a reminder that we must confront the systemic inequalities that have allowed these disparities to exist.

https://t.co/fzBR5BXAtg The #AmericanJobsPlan is an ambitious and much-needed investment in 21st century infrastructure.

It will invest in:

üå≤Outdoor restoration &amp; resilience;
üíªBroadband;
üèûÔ∏èRural infrastructure;

&amp; so much more.

From cities to rural counties, communities across America will benefit. I look forward to working with the administration and Congress to make this ambitious and much-needed infrastructure investment. Just like our roads and bridges, our natural infrastructure is vital to our economy in Colorado and across the West.

Communities across America -- from rural counties to cities -- will benefit from the president‚Äôs plan. I‚Äôm especially pleased the president‚Äôs plan includes my outdoor restoration bill, which will create jobs by supporting locally-led forest health and watershed restoration projects. This legislation was written in partnership with Coloradans. Ô∏è @POTUS's plan includes priorities that I repeatedly hear about in Colorado -- from investing in broadband to supporting rural water infrastructure. If we want to build an economy that delivers opportunity for all, fights climate change, and competes with China, we have to invest in 21st century American infrastructure.

I'm confident her expertise in addressing some of this country‚Äôs toughest public health challenges will help bring us through this pandemic and beyond. 
 
She is a critical addition to @HHSGov. Expanding the Child Tax Credit will cut child poverty in half. It's the best we've seen out of Washington in generations, but there‚Äôs more to do. My goal is to end child poverty in our country. When we do that, I'll know that every kid in America has a fair shot at a better life. https://t.co/GDJSv3qkof The Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit expansions in the American Rescue Plan will have a transformative effect on millions of Americans. @SenSherrodBrown, @SenBooker, @SenatorWarnock and I led 41 Senate Democrats in urging @POTUS to make these expansions permanent. https://t.co/Q0Isc9V64x My daughters' generation has grown up with a reasonable fear that they will be shot in their classrooms, or in their schools, or at a movie theater.

Great to join @HispanicAccess and @GreenLatinos today to discuss the urgent need to address this crisis. Our challenges demand leaders like Ambassador Burns who understand the strength of U.S. leadership is rooted in our alliances and based on our values. 

I'm confident as CIA Director he will help our intelligence community prepare for current and future threats. Farmworkers have sustained the nation during this pandemic. House passage of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act is a step toward bringing them much-needed certainty. @MikeCrapo and I look forward to introducing companion legislation in the Senate. https://t.co/hnHoqwZ76M The House just passed the Dream &amp; Promise Act to ensure a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, TPS holders, and DED recipients.

https://t.co/g9AayGJ0yg Congratulations to @USTradeRep, Katherine Tai. At her hearing, we discussed the importance of an approach to trade that prioritizes American families, farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. I look forward to working with her to advance Colorado‚Äôs interests on the global stage. Great to join @One_Colorado this week to discuss the #EqualityAct. Their continued advocacy to ensure equality for the LGBTQ community in our state has pushed us closer to fulfilling our promise of equality for all. 
    
It's time for Washington to follow Colorado's lead. https://t.co/aWXjXH9fQd By passing the #ForthePeople Act, we can take a historic step toward getting the money out of politics and bringing the American people back in.
 
We can fix our broken politics and do our job to hand the next generation a democracy in better shape than we found it. The For the People Act includes my ideas to:
 
‚úîÔ∏èBan partisan gerrymandering;
‚úîÔ∏èClose lobbyist loopholes; and
‚úîÔ∏èMake voting easier for college students.

It also draws on our leadership in Colorado to expand automatic voter registration and mail-in voting. Our democracy is at risk ‚Äì from voter suppression, dark money, foreign interference, and more. Like generations before us, we have a duty to strengthen our democracy. 
 
We can do that with the #ForThePeople Act, the most consequential reform proposal in a generation. THREAD‚¨áÔ∏è I am appalled by the deadly shootings in Georgia last night and grieve for the victims of this senseless violence.

We have a responsibility to stand up against hate in all its forms. #StopAAPIHate Our economy has worked really well for the wealthiest individuals, but not for 90% of the American people. The tax credits in the American Rescue Plan are a step toward building an economy that provides opportunity for everyone, not just those at the top. https://t.co/a0MzlLwfJj Grateful for the @VP's visit to Colorado today. When Vice President Harris was a senator, we worked together to expand the Child Tax Credit. Now that vision has become a reality. Look forward to working together again to make it permanent. Climate change threatens our way of life in the West, which is why it's crucial that we‚Äôve expanded the scope of the conservation and forestry subcommittee to focus on bipartisan, locally-led climate solutions. 

Let's get to work. https://t.co/ftwnKesmHw Congratulations to @Interior Secretary @DebHaalandNM on her historic confirmation!

Storms in Denver kept me from voting last night, but nothing will stop me from working with her to protect our public lands. On what would have been Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's 88th birthday, we remember her dedication to calling America closer to our best traditions of equality, liberty, and opportunity for all.

It's on us to carry forward her legacy and live up to her example. #WomensHistoryMonth I am deeply concerned about the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia‚Äôs Tigray region and the growing reports of crimes against civilians. The Ethiopian government must help end the violence and allow humanitarian workers, human rights monitors, and journalists full access. Historically, Americans with the lowest incomes have not been eligible for the Child Tax Credit. But through the expansion passed in the American Rescue Plan, 90% of kids in Colorado will now benefit.

This will be a tremendous help to families across the country. https://t.co/tc6wf1W7SZ No child chooses to be born poor, but growing up in poverty can shape a child‚Äôs future in ways that are deeply unfair. Read my op-ed in the @ColoradoSun about how we will cut childhood poverty in half through the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/Ct5E0kt9yG A report from @familiesUSA found a third of #COVID19 deaths are linked to health insurance gaps. This is unacceptable. 
 
We urgently need a public option like Medicare-X to help us achieve universal coverage in this country. https://t.co/rBJKccxM6O Recently, @ChrisMurphyCT and I spoke with enrichment experts about how summer programming helps address kids‚Äô academic, social, and emotional needs. The American Rescue Plan provides dedicated funding for school programs so our kids are prepared for the fall. https://t.co/OkcuIeVZ9k ""Nevertheless, the Child Tax Credit is an idea whose time has come.""
 
By passing this tax credit expansion through the American Rescue Plan, child poverty in this country will be cut in half. 
 
Now, let's work to make it permanent. https://t.co/HllmWSJMz3 This week, I sat down with @JWhitePubRadio on @1A to discuss the Child Tax Credit expansion that was included in the American Rescue Plan and how it will lift millions of kids out of poverty. 

Listen here ‚¨áÔ∏èhttps://t.co/k9sB6g2NGP Nationwide, 90% of kids will benefit from the Child Tax Credit passed in the American Rescue Plan.

This is huge. https://t.co/NVsq9NQqtI One year ago, police broke down Breonna Taylor‚Äôs door and shot her multiple times in her own apartment.

She should still be with us today.

We owe it to Breonna, Black Americans, and all victims of racial violence to seek justice. Because of the stronger Child Tax Credit‚Äî modeled on my American Family Act‚Äî passed in the relief package, most families in America will receive $3,000 per child and $3,600 per young child to help cover rent, buy groceries, and pay for necessities.

This will be transformational. https://t.co/yRUJK87NsD The Earned Income Tax Credit passed in the American Rescue Plan will benefit working Americans across the country, including:

‚úîÔ∏è17 million childless workers nationwide 
‚úîÔ∏èNearly 300,000 workers in Colorado 

But our work isn't done. We need to make these tax credits permanent. Soon, I'll be joining @KatyTurNBC on MSNBC to discuss how the American Rescue Plan will cut childhood poverty in half.

Tune in now! It was a pleasure to meet with three phenomenal @SenateYouth delegates from Colorado this week. These students are already leaders in their communities and I can't wait to see what they achieve in the years ahead. https://t.co/oM17sa6u5T Coloradans have told me they're working as hard as they can, but can't afford some combination of housing, health care, child care, or higher education. The Child Tax Credit passed in the American Rescue Plan will make an enormous difference in their lives.https://t.co/zD5P22ZGrP In Colorado alone, the expanded Child Tax Credit will benefit almost 90% of kids and lift 57,000 children out of poverty.

It is a historic step toward a society that doesn‚Äôt just talk about family values but that actually values families.

My op-ed‚¨áÔ∏èhttps://t.co/Ct5E0kt9yG .@POTUS just signed the American Rescue Plan ‚Äî a historic step toward bridging our way out of this crisis and building an economy that works for everyone.

We just passed a bill that will cut child poverty in half. It is only the beginning of what we can do.

@SenSchumer is right. Help is on the way. https://t.co/7AMSGQSuQE The Child Tax Credit in the relief plan will cut childhood poverty in half. This wouldn‚Äôt be possible without the incredible partnership of @SenSherrodBrown,@SenBooker, @rosadelauro, @RepDelBene, and @RepRitchie.

He is of the highest intellect and character and appreciates DOJ's vital role in defending the rule of law and hard-won civil rights. I enthusiastically supported his confirmation. GREAT NEWS: the House just passed the American Rescue Plan.

From investing in public health to cutting childhood poverty in half, this historic legislation will help us beat the pandemic and provide immediate relief to millions of Americans.

This is what progress looks like. We have to make sure that families still reeling from the pandemic don't face eviction and fall into the cycle of poverty and homelessness that too often follow it. I look forward to working with @HUDgov Secretary @mlfudge to support families and keep people in their homes. https://t.co/TkPmmQyRDe Our work is not over; we need to make these tax credits permanent.

From funding for public health jobs to expanded tax credits for families, this bill will help us put an end to the pandemic, cut child poverty in half, and improve the lives of countless Americans. This has been a long and painful process. But morning is here. The sun is out. And in a few hours, we're going to pass the American Rescue Plan. The child tax credit included in the American Rescue Plan will benefit more than a million children in Colorado. This is the most transformative thing we can do for children and families in generations. https://t.co/toyExeGh3i Tonight, I had the honor of presiding over the Senate for the first time since 2014. 
 
We‚Äôre going to get big things done for this country, and that starts with passing the American Rescue Plan. So glad General Raymond, @SpaceForceCSO, and General Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited Colorado Springs this week to see the hub of military space operations at @SchrieverAFB and @PeteAFB.

Colorado is proud to support this critical mission. When Sen. Johnson voted to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, he didn't force staff to read the bill. But now that working people need help, he's forcing a delay.

That's why we‚Äôre going to do everything we can to get this over the finish line now, and then work to make these changes permanent moving forward. In Colorado alone, this provision would boost incomes for 300,000 workers, lift 57,000 kids out of poverty, and benefit over a million kids statewide ‚Äî including nearly 350,000 kids who have been completely left out of the full existing child credit. HAPPENING NOW: I'm joining @SenBooker, @SenSherrodBrown, and @SenatorWarnock to discuss the #AmericanRescuePlan and its tax credit expansions.

We are on the verge of doing more to eradicate child poverty in this country than we have in generations. The American people know that growing up in poverty can shape a child‚Äôs future in ways that are deeply unfair.

This afternoon, I'm joining @SenBooker, @SenSherrodBrown, and @SenatorWarnock to discuss how the #AmericanRescuePlan can cut child poverty in half.
 
Let's get it done. https://t.co/Kk540AcgIl Women like Colorado's Dr. Justina Ford and Janet Bonnema spent their lives breaking barriers. 

This #WomensHistoryMonth, we celebrate extraordinary contributions of women like them who fought to push America closer to its highest ideals of equality and opportunity for all. I'm confident @GinaRaimondo will harness American innovation as @CommerceGov Secretary to create good-paying jobs and help U.S. businesses compete in today's global market. 
 
I look forward to working with her to ensure America leads the 21st century economy. https://t.co/nirnXmqYc1 As a former public school student, teacher, and school leader, @teachcardona has the experience and skills necessary to lead our nation's schools during this pandemic and after. I'm eager to see all that he will accomplish as Secretary of Education. https://t.co/w2jmJKKlHi Right now, we have a tremendous opportunity to lift kids out of poverty and provide much-needed support to families across the country.

After we pass our child tax credit proposal as a part of the #AmericanRescuePlan, I'll keep fighting to make sure it's made permanent. https://t.co/5enzobq5ZK In the West, our forests are as essential to our economy as the Lincoln Tunnel is to New York.

As a country, we have to start investing in America‚Äôs forests and outdoors like the essential infrastructure that they are. https://t.co/fcWkzmbj6P We will provide economic security to millions of families through our child tax credit proposal included in the #AmericanRescuePlan.

I hope my colleagues will join @brianschatz, @CoryBooker, @SenSherrodBrown, and me in fighting to ensure these tax credits are made permanent. https://t.co/2tAyRFSqxj Millions of people have lost their jobs during this crisis through no fault of their own.
 
Instead of ending expanded unemployment benefits on an arbitrary date, we should tie them to economic conditions so families aren't thrown into financial crisis. https://t.co/u7kDD5luOB This would transform the lives of millions of American children. Let‚Äôs get as many of our colleagues talking about it as we can. @CoryBooker and @SenSherrodBrown, can you help us? https://t.co/7VCm4Nh9Rm That‚Äôs why I fought to include my proposal to expand the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit in this plan, which will cut child poverty in half and provide economic security to millions of families. 

I will keep fighting to ensure these tax credits are made permanent. I applaud House passage of the #AmericanRescuePlan as we continue to face this massive public health and economic crisis.

We need to take bold, decisive action to stem the tide of the pandemic and build our economy back better than it was before. https://t.co/q5N3myqO9Q Thrilled to see the #COREAct pass the House today thanks to the work of @RepJoeNeguse, @RepJasonCrow, @RepDianaDeGette, and @RepPerlmutter. @SenatorHick and I look forward to passing this landmark bill in the Senate to finally get this done for Coloradans. https://t.co/cwel1P8eyr The release of this report demonstrates the U.S. won't turn a blind eye to Jamal Khashoggi‚Äôs brutal murder and affirms our commitment to freedom of the press.

Watch here: https://t.co/GeQDq3tqbT As I traveled all 64 Colorado counties, people told me they're really struggling. These conversations informed my #COVID19 relief priorities, and virtually all are included in the #AmericanRescuePlan. 

Let's get this much-needed relief to families. https://t.co/ua97KbtM65 Our history has been a story of our struggle between the promise of equality and the reality of inequality in America. Today, the House passed the #EqualityAct to help fulfill that promise for LGBTQ Americans.

It's past time for the Senate act. Let's do our job &amp; pass this bill. https://t.co/dsQFXk2MpB Elijah McClain should be celebrating his 25th birthday today.

Looking forward to working with you to harness American innovation and tackle the climate challenge. We are proud of our long-standing leadership on climate solutions in Colorado &amp; eager to keep working to build a 21st century clean energy economy. https://t.co/sPJAxnqTEu We can cut child poverty in HALF, and move toward an economy that actually supports families and working people. 
 
We now have a historic opportunity to get this done and show the American people that we can make our democracy work for them. What I hear all over Colorado is that people are working harder than ever, but they still can‚Äôt afford some combination of child care, health care, housing, and higher education. 
 
An expansion of the CTC and EITC would make a huge difference in people‚Äôs lives. HAPPENING NOW: I'm joining @SenSchumer, @SenSherrodBrown, and @SenBooker to discuss new data that shows the popularity of and bipartisan support for the American Rescue Plan‚Äôs expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Growing up in poverty can shape the future of kids across this country in ways that are deeply unfair &amp; un-American. We can cut childhood poverty nearly in half by expanding the Child Tax Credit‚Äîsomething @SenBooker, @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I have continued to push. Let's get it done. https://t.co/CRClgtgIuh We need an experienced leader like @XavierBecerra leading @HHSGov to help ensure everyone has access to high quality, affordable health care -- something @timkaine and I hope to achieve through our Medicare-X proposal.
 
I look forward to supporting his nomination. https://t.co/pTiGLh4bnh These priorities are all reflective of my conversations with Coloradans ‚Äî and virtually all are included in the American Rescue Plan.

I look forward to getting this done for Coloradans and families across the country in need of immediate relief. Wherever I went, people told me they're really struggling.

That's why in Washington, I fought to expand the Child Tax Credit, strengthen unemployment benefits, to increase SNAP, and to provide relief for state and local governments and the hardest-hit small businesses."

Wishing all who observe a blessed #GoodFriday Our country needs a bipartisan and targeted approach to improving infrastructure. President Joe Biden ran on a platform of unity, but since taking office has shown his true colors as an unrestrained partisan. It will strip Americans of their right to work by forcing them to join Democrat-backed unions. This ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô plan is another Trojan horse for the radical left.
Roads need repair, and commuters are begging for highways to be expanded. Not even six percent of President Joe Biden's massive $2 trillion ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô bill would be used to build roads and bridges. Biden's plan includes the largest tax hike in nearly three decades, but of course, coastal elites will have their taxes slashed. Until we secure our southern border, every town is a border town, and every state is a border state. No one knows that better than America‚Äôs ranchers.¬†I spoke with Arizona rancher John Ladd who shared his first-hand experience with the #BidenBorderCrisis https://t.co/ehq6ccV8ny With a corporate tax rate of 28%, Biden will drag the US back to a time when businesses sent jobs overseas to countries with friendlier rates. American jobs should stay here. As a member of the House, I sponsored the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid legislation that was enacted into law to increase accessibility to hearing aids for millions of Americans.

This is good news!
https://t.co/35NC9Bg6ui Joe Biden created a crisis at our southern border. Both sheriff‚Äôs have seen a massive uptick since Biden has taken office. @sherifflamb1 @cc_sheriff https://t.co/VtsizNB6Re He‚Äôs had his trucks, barns and buildings broken into countless times and every day multiple groups of illegals cross his land. John told me he shouldn‚Äôt have to live like this in America. I spoke with John Ladd, a local rancher in Cochise County, who told me in the past 30 years he‚Äôs had over a dozen dead illegal immigrants on his ranch. https://t.co/WnGh9XrInZ Under Biden‚Äôs open border policy: every town is a border town and every state is a border state. https://t.co/nUBniRIdLy I‚Äôm at the border wall where construction has stopped because of President Biden‚Äôs open border policy. The construction crews built a road that‚Äôs now being used by the cartel courtesy of Biden. @sherifflamb1 @cc_sheriff https://t.co/YvIAMLhmnt https://t.co/xX7jF7Ql40 Coyotes are trafficking illegal immigrants dressed in camouflage from the southern border up through an Indian reservation. They end up in Pinal County where they wait in the bushes along the freeway for cars to come grab them. Since President Biden has taken office, @sherifflamb1 @PinalCSO has already had 40 car pursuits chasing illegal immigrants. I‚Äôm on the ground in Pinal County with @sherifflamb1 @PinalCSO getting a firsthand view of how the border crisis is impacting communities. Cartels are using human smugglers as mules to take drugs across the border and push them into our neighborhoods. https://t.co/AcepA3Uct5 .@AEDCnews in Tullahoma, TN is often referred to as the Air Force‚Äôs best kept secret.¬† Though, it is no secret that this community‚Äôs commitment to the needs of our citizens is crucial to securing our nation‚Äôs freedom.

https://t.co/f0rtUkxmFX The border crisis is out of control. I‚Äôll be visiting our southern border tomorrow to get the facts and see the crisis firsthand.

I look forward to joining @sherifflamb1 @PinalCSO and @cc_sheriff. https://t.co/uahTyBI744 President Biden does not want you to see the crisis happening under his watch.

Why won‚Äôt the Biden administration follow the science? Prisoners and illegal immigrants are being rewarded with stimulus checks after breaking our nation‚Äôs laws.

"Blumenthal, Richard",SenBlumenthal,,Connecticut,Connecticut,Senator," There is real concern that cruises may prematurely set sail w/o safety precautions to stop COVID. It's of paramount importance that the CDC fully &amp; aggressively enforce safety requirements. We can't allow history to repeat itself‚Äîpassengers/crews‚Äô lives are at stake. https://t.co/KPc1GaQR62 Gun violence is a public health crisis that we must address with the full force of the federal government.

We need the Senate to take action. https://t.co/J6DakcFGLW Tech targeting kids w/insidious influencer culture‚Äînew techniques like Instagram for kids‚Äîmust be stopped. My consumer protection subcommittee will hold hearings to pass laws meeting the threat‚Äîdangerous appeals to young minds who can‚Äôt see the deception. https://t.co/bRI2boFtNv Anti-Asian hate crimes have increased by 150% in major U.S. cities over the past year. Deeply unacceptable.

I stand with my¬†colleagues &amp; the AAPI community to condemn these horrific acts of violence. We must come together, pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, &amp; #StopAsianHate. Thrilled to cast my vote for Brenda Mallory. Her¬†CT roots, diligent work ethic, &amp; belief in the importance of environmental justice make her the perfect person to Chair the Council on Environmental Quality. https://t.co/flLmoSSo1R 8/ The NO HATE Act has support across the ideological, political, &amp; geographic spectrums. I‚Äôm proud of the bipartisan coalition we‚Äôve built in Congress &amp; am grateful for the advocates working tirelessly to stop this violence &amp; get this legislation passed. https://t.co/uyFaH4JimX 7/ To get lasting change we can‚Äôt just lock up those convicted of these crimes, but must also work to combat bias &amp; bigotry. The NO HATE Act would allow courts to implement alternative sentencing‚Äîrequiring people to do educational training/community service to counter their hate. 6/¬†Hotlines are especially important because they help to give victims a voice, build trust, &amp; provide an opportunity for people to be connected to community-based support systems. 5/ The NO HATE Act will improve reporting systems so there is a robust process in place. The primary tactics:

Grants to states &amp; localities for training, outreach, specialized units, &amp; reporting system enhancements.

State hotlines victims can directly call to report an attack. 4/ Right now local reporting systems are woefully underutilized because of systemic problems in identifying &amp; recording these crimes. 3/ We know that knowledge is power, but when it comes to hate crimes the FBI &amp; other law enforcement don‚Äôt have the data to fully understand the¬†scope &amp;¬†complexities¬†of the problem¬†hate crimes pose‚Äîwhich is necessary to implement¬†comprehensive, meaningful solutions. 2/ Hate crimes are an especially egregious form of violence because they not only seriously harm the person who was attacked, but traumatize &amp; terrify entire communities to which they belong. Hate crimes are on the rise &amp; Congress must take action to help stop this bigoted violence. ¬†

1/ Here‚Äôs a quick thread on why the Senate should waste no time in passing the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act as part of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. Gun violence again hits home. It does so often. We cannot be numbed or cease being outraged.https://t.co/gPsMGBUljM Beyond moving to walk hand in hand with my friend @GabbyGiffords through @GiffordsCourage‚Äôs gun violence memorial, where each flower represents a life lost to gun violence. The truth is our country has done enough thinking &amp; praying about this crisis‚Äîthe time for action is now. https://t.co/bEwywRlucU The FAA must immediately begin implementing the NTSB recommendations for the safety sake of all who fly in these living flight history experience airplanes.¬†I will demand a timeline for implementing these recommendations &amp; see to it that these changes are promptly implemented. The NTSB accident report reveals a series of failures on the part of Collings‚Äô staff &amp; reinforces my call for the FAA to tighten its regulations &amp; oversight. For too long, the FAA has deferred to the historic airplane‚Äôs owner on safety compliance. https://t.co/Cwn33JbSQ0 35 AGs from red &amp; blue states agree, the NO HATE Act would help to fix the inaccurate &amp; incomplete data that often stymies &amp; stalls real progress on combating hate crimes. Hate must not be able to spread, grow, &amp; terrorize. Congress must act. https://t.co/qSKtGDU3Mq Officer Billy Evans made the ultimate sacrifice protecting &amp; defending our democracy. On this sad, somber day, my thoughts &amp; deep condolences are with his loved ones &amp; the entire US @CapitolPolice force. I am closely monitoring the situation in Branford. 

Thinking of the first responders &amp; all those involved. https://t.co/RXdbFfZY2U A powerful vision &amp; starting point, this is a blueprint for building a better CT, helping many projects that I &amp; others have advocated.

Today, I joined CT advocates to call on Congress to match his courage &amp; pass real, meaningful legislation. #TheTimeIsNow #EndGunViolence https://t.co/bNsUM5lYZr Gov. DeSantis suing the CDC is a craven political stunt pandering to cruise companies. He seems to care more about their profits than passengers at risk of COVID-19. No way should the CDC send cruise ships to sea now. https://t.co/qHiIAjSzGh Exactly, @RepAdamSchiff. Our legislation will¬†give victims of gun violence their day in court &amp; unlock the doors to justice‚Äîrepealing the sweetheart deal that prevents the gun lobby from being¬†sued.¬†#RepealPLCAA https://t.co/rqhLoPrevR On Yom HaShoah we remember the millions of Jews &amp; countless others murdered during the Holocaust. We honor their memories &amp; recommit to creating a world without hate, anti-Semitism, &amp; intolerance. These acts of evil must never happen again. Together, we represent communities throughout the country &amp; viewpoints across the political spectrum, which is just one reason why I think this bill is so powerful. Congress should take up this legislation ASAP. There is no time to waste when it comes to stopping hate. I‚Äôm proud of the bipartisan coalition‚Äîincluding @JerryMoran, @RepDonBeyer, @RepFredUpton, @RepJudyChu, &amp; @VernBuchanan‚Äîwe‚Äôve built to advance the NO HATE Act &amp; grateful for the backing of so many leading advocacy &amp; law enforcement organizations. The rise in hate crimes is so insidious because it harms &amp; terrorizes individuals &amp; entire communities. By passing the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, Congress can provide the tools necessary to stop the underreporting of these crimes &amp; get the info needed to end this bigoted violence. A stirring, searing call to action from the President‚Äîreal action not merely rhetoric. He wears his heart on his sleeve. Congress must now match his courage.

üì∑: @ChrisMurphyCT https://t.co/ReRtaHf82y Just left the White House listening to President Biden speak with such power, eloquence, passion about the moral imperative for gun violence prevention. Sad to learn of Gary Bimonte‚Äôs passing. When you think of pizza, you think of Pepe‚Äôs. My thoughts are with his family during this difficult time. Thank you, Gary, for many great slices &amp; memories. https://t.co/YlD9FGoZmz Greetings to so many heroes‚Äîfamilies who‚Äôve endured gun violence &amp; its grief &amp; pain, advocates like @GabbyGiffords  @fred_guttenberg @po_murray &amp; @markbardenSHP, all at today's Rose Garden event. Excitement, anticipation, hope, solemnity all mix on this beautiful sun-filled day. Arriving at the White House for President Biden‚Äôs announcement of historic gun violence prevention executive action. Every corner of America is impacted by this violence &amp; I look forward to working with the President to pass commonsense policy that will save lives. A powerful &amp; chilling warning from a survivor on the terrifying increase in grooming, exploitation, &amp; abuse of children online. @LindseyGrahamSC &amp; my EARN IT Act will finally hold Big Tech accountable for this crime against kids. Change cannot wait. https://t.co/1XTRi9ai3e The commonsense steps the Biden Admin is taking will save lives &amp; prevent injuries &amp; trauma that ripple through every corner of America. But executive orders from one president can be changed by another, so strong &amp; effective laws to prevent gun violence are still critical. 7/7 This public health epidemic demands a comprehensive, ‚Äúwhole of government‚Äù solution. Bold &amp; inclusive investments in evidence-based, community-violence intervention programs will address the daily toll of gun violence‚Äî&amp; its disproportionate impact on communities of color. 6/7 There is no reason that a gun built in your kitchen should be treated any differently that one bought in a store. 5/7 The action on ghost guns will protect against untraceable, homemade weapons that no law abiding gun owner would want. We‚Äôve seen a large increase in the sale &amp; use of these dangerous DIY weapons since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, making this action all the more urgent. 4/7 ERPO laws are already on the books in 19 states &amp; DC &amp; a model bill that provides best practices &amp; critical guidance will help even more states follow suit. 3/7 I‚Äôm especially glad to see steps to expand ERPO laws. For years, I‚Äôve worked to provide additional support for states seeking to help law enforcement take action when there is solid evidence that someone is in crisis‚Äîintensely &amp; imminently a danger to themselves or to others. 2/7 This is the most significant executive action on gun violence in a generation. These actions set a model of courage &amp; strength that Congress must now match. 1/7 https://t.co/HIASx6VOPa This great training program targeting women to be welders &amp; iron workers, which is run by the Ironworkers Local 15, shows the way to providing skills vital to revitalizing infrastructure. A wonderful example for President Biden, Congress, &amp; the nation. https://t.co/NsJ36LKmUf Judge out at Eversource is welcome news, but we need more than a change at the top. Our electric utilities should be accountable to the people, not shareholders. Joe Nolan must make customer service &amp; lowering rates his number one priority.

To the nurses, doctors, researchers, professionals, &amp; advocates‚Äîthank you. #NPHW Right now countless people around CT cannot put food on the table without the kind of assistance @foodshare provides. I will continue to fight for more federal funding to help support these programs &amp; work to end food insecurity. https://t.co/jQlyty7Kvp Hate has no place in our community or country. Deeply troubling &amp; terrible attacks‚Äîlike the one at @MotlenJava‚Äîare why I am fighting to pass the NO HATE Act. https://t.co/G4pMqTRkuc Strong oversight isn't about political punishment, it's about making sure companies that received critical contracts are the ones who deserved it. Contracts¬†for COVID-19 vaccines &amp; other pre-pandemic work should be investigated to ensure there was no political favoritism. Significant oversight is still needed of Trump‚Äôs Operation Warp Speed contracts. Questions &amp; nefarious circumstances still abound.¬†

For example, a top Trump HHS official held an undisclosed position as a former consultant for Emergent, whose plant botched 15M J&amp;J vaccines. https://t.co/NfW37jxKaG A crackdown on violent extremists&amp;white supremacists requires real resources&amp;top leadership. The growing, persistent&amp;lethal threat of domestic extremism must be confronted unsparingly. DOJ should run point w/Congress ready to supply additional resources.https://t.co/De3l7SAi85 Confining thousands on board for days on end makes every cruise ship a potential petri dish for COVID infection‚Äîsounding alarm bells. The cruise line industry seems intent on setting sail with scarce concern‚Äîscarily‚Äîfor science or consumers. Throwing caution &amp; precaution to the winds is no way to go back to sea.¬†https://t.co/QRTmly0yJQ I‚Äôm thrilled by hundreds coming to FEMA‚Äôs mobile vaccination van on Easter Sunday.

All can share the spirit of hope &amp; renewal. Proud to stand with advocates &amp; allies in Fairfield at today‚Äôs Stop AAPI Hate rally. This violence traumatizes &amp; terrorizes communities. In Congress, we must do everything in our power to help stop the sickening, despicable rise in hate crimes‚Äîlike passing the NO HATE Act. https://t.co/cHhxGUX2x8 Being pro-democracy shouldn‚Äôt land you in prison, yet that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening in HK.

Great to stop by, thank our wonderful public health workers, &amp; see the clinics in action. https://t.co/YXtU0EeLZO First Congregational Church‚Äôs moving memorial is a striking, somber tribute to lost lives. As I walked amongst the flags yesterday morning, my heart broke for CT‚Äôs COVID victims &amp; loved ones. https://t.co/KVSEB2Tkit My thoughts are with all of the Capitol Police who have endured so much in recent months. Our hearts are shattered by the courageous sacrifice of Officer William ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù Evans &amp; the entire Capitol Police force, again putting their lives on the line for our safety &amp; security. I have no words to match the magnitude of this loss. My thoughts are with the injured officers &amp; their families after today‚Äôs violence. Thank you to all the @CapitolPolice &amp; first responders who risked their lives today‚Äî&amp; every day‚Äîto keep the Capitol complex safe. https://t.co/1i12RIQPrA Congrats @jordyn_wieber on being selected for the USOPC Commission. Your courage &amp; conviction will serve you well as you continue to be a champion for athletes &amp; speak truth to power. Congress must also pass @SenBooker &amp; my¬†College¬†Athletes¬†Bill¬†of¬†Rights so these students have¬†the protections &amp; justice they so desperately deserve. The NCAA should take immediately action to fix the harmful disparities¬†female athletes face.

Sexist inequalities‚Äîunacceptable. 

Not allowing students to¬†share in the profit from their hard work¬†while the NCAA makes bank‚Äîinexcusable.¬†

This must stop. This morning I heard¬†clear, compelling concerns about the NCAA¬†from talented men &amp; women college athletes. I‚Äôll continue to push¬†in¬†Congress to hold the NCAA¬†accountable for¬†its¬†antiquated rules &amp;¬†unconscionable¬†mistreatment of players. #NotNCAAProperty https://t.co/AyU1Y4uUpc No one should have to face the unimaginable grief of losing a child because of an unsecured firearm.

I look forward to working with my colleagues &amp; the Biden Administration to make sure we deliver for the American people. The American Jobs Plan will help fix our long neglected roads, bridges,¬†railways,¬†&amp; highways as well as improve our electric grid, broadband access, &amp; housing/school infrastructure. Biden‚Äôs infrastructure proposal is historic &amp; momentous. The American Jobs Plan puts us on the right track to modernize &amp; prepare for the future, all while creating millions of high quality jobs &amp; a more equitable &amp; sustainable economy.

What a thrilling, moving visit by my friend @VP Harris - her energy &amp; passion inspiring us to rebuild a child care industry devastated by the pandemic. Child care workers are heroes. The American Rescue Plan made one of the greatest investments in reducing child poverty in history. In a country that has as many resources as ours, no kid should have to go to bed hungry, grow up without an adequate education, or suffer without medication when they‚Äôre sick. Over the last year, I‚Äôve visited day cares across CT &amp; I‚Äôve seen how hard caregivers work, how joyful kids are to be with each other &amp; what a relief it is for working parents to know their children are somewhere safe and happy. The American Rescue Plan made major investments in day care centers like New Haven‚Äôs Boys &amp; Girls Club - affordable child care is absolutely fundamental to getting our economy back on track &amp; giving working parents the helping hand they‚Äôve been missing. It was an honor to host my old Senate seatmate @VP Harris in New Haven - doubly proud to have her here with Connecticut‚Äôs own @SecCardona! There is no room in our society for the discrimination &amp; violence that has been directed at our brothers &amp; sisters in the AAPI community. Let‚Äôs take a stand against bigotry &amp; racism to #StopAsianHate &amp; pass the NO HATE Act. https://t.co/uCxb2ovuJy As Chair of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, I have long championed the Commission using all of its rulemaking &amp; enforcement authorities to hold lawbreakers accountable, to reign in Big Tech, to set consumer safeguards, &amp; to protect American workers.

And Dems blocked efforts to cut unnecessary spending and focus resources on priorities like reopening schools. Instead of building on the successful pattern of bipartisanship that allowed us to pass 5 COVID relief packages last year, Democrats rammed through a bill filled with untimely spending and misplaced priorities. Democrats‚Äô massive spending bill, and the partisan process by which it was passed, fails the American people. Parents want their kids in the classroom.

Democrats‚Äô nearly $2 trillion package is NOT about getting kids back in schools, vaccinating more Americans, and reopening Main Street businesses. It‚Äôs about advancing a far-left agenda that is completely unrelated to the pandemic. In the last year, the Senate has passed five COVID-19 relief bills ‚Äì each with overwhelming bipartisan support.
But now Senate Democrats are ramming through a massive spending bill filled with partisan policies unrelated to helping Americans during the pandemic. https://t.co/nMNryXFkpR Instead of ensuring existing resources are being used effectively to respond to the COVID pandemic, Democrats are pushing for an additional $1.9 trillion &amp; claiming every dollar of it is needed immediately.

It‚Äôs clear: Their plan is NOT about providing real relief to help Americans recovering from the pandemic.

@NationalFFA does great work developing the next great generation of American leaders &amp; I know the young men &amp; women of @MissouriFFA will keep Mo ag thriving in the years ahead. It‚Äôs been almost a year since classrooms shifted to virtual learning.

Unfortunately, we‚Äôve seen that a generation is falling behind on education &amp; prolonged remote learning is taking a toll on kids‚Äô mental health.

Kids need to go back to school. 

https://t.co/CKusIUruEm The facts are clear - kids need to be back in school. https://t.co/Jh7j9uASKy In the Democrats' $1.9 trillion package:

‚ùåOnly 1% of the money would go for COVID-19 vaccines
‚ùåJust 5% is focused on pandemic public health

Congress has already provided $67.5 billion to do just that. 
So far, states have only spent about $5 billion of that money.

There are no excuses: it's time to get kids back to in-person learning. We need to 
üëç Boost our economy
üëç Get kids back in school
üëç Help more Americans get the vaccine

Instead, Democrats are pushing a progressive policy wish list filled with things that have nothing to do with COVID relief.

And it has a $1.9 trillion price tag. üëé House Democrats passed a $1.9 trillion package packed with far-left policies that do nothing to help Americans impacted by the pandemic, including

‚ùåDem pet projects

‚ùåMinimum wage mandate that would destroy jobs

‚ùåSlush funds for big-spending states

https://t.co/Bi9oV1XLoK Prolonged remote learning is putting kids at risk of falling behind, failing classes, and suffering from mental health problems.

That risk is even greater for students with disabilities, minorities, and those in underserved areas.

It's time to get kids back in schools safely. https://t.co/Tdu1Mdp7xq The Iran Sanctions Relief Review Act of 2021 would require the administration to have Congress‚Äôs approval to roll back sanctions, which are critical to holding the regime accountable. https://t.co/dY4iYQ71cF Easing sanctions on Iran - the world‚Äôs number-one state sponsor of terrorism - would be a dangerous mistake. The regime continues to pursue nuclear weapons and destabilize the Middle East. CDC reports trips to emergency rooms for mental health issues increased 31% in the teen age group last year.

The rest would be spent over the next 7 years. Funding is not the issue. Congress has provided $67.5 billion to help schools reopen safely. So far, states have spent just under $5 billion of that funding. Health experts agree we need to get kids back into the classroom, but the Biden administration and congressional Democrats are refusing to listen ‚Äì even to experts in the administration. üßµ
Numerous studies show that prolonged remote learning puts kids at higher risk of falling behind, failing classes, and suffering from mental health problems. I recently offered an amendment to the budget bill that would have helped get kids back in school after teachers were vaccinated.

Over the years, he's become my brother. He‚Äôs someone who I‚Äôve relied on during our toughest challenges. He‚Äôs built and led an incredible, diverse and inclusive team in the Senate‚Äîto say he‚Äôll be missed is an understatement. Matt is the rare leader who can build coalitions &amp; who has the integrity, intellect &amp; grit to always do what‚Äôs right &amp; make a difference. He's going to do great things at DOJ &amp; continue the fight for social, racial &amp; economic justice. I‚Äôm excited for him, AG Garland &amp; our nation. 21 years ago, a young @MattKlapper joined me on a mission to advance civil rights &amp; opportunity. After decades in the trenches &amp; years as my chief of staff, Matt joined DOJ in January‚Äîwith today‚Äôs confirmation, he'll officially serve as AG Garland's COS.

It's up to us to ensure this painful history is never forgotten. Hatred and anti-Semitism must always be condemned. #HolocaustRemembranceDay Yes @JoeBiden! https://t.co/z8bKoXfImk Attaching a profit motive to imprisonment will always be unconscionable.

I'm very glad @JoeBiden agrees. https://t.co/WdnlI1K4kl I proudly cast my vote tonight to confirm @JanetYellen as the first woman to serve as Treasury Secretary. Her extensive experience and thoughtful leadership is much needed at @USTreasury during this time of unprecedented economic crisis. This is justice.

These young people deserve justice. https://t.co/KdOiuVkho8 After the last four years, this is incredibly healing. https://t.co/PSmK75PGmf Congratulations to @LloydAustin on his historic confirmation as our country's first Black Defense Secretary. I'm eager to work with him and his team on addressing our top national security challenges. Hank Aaron was not only a home run king, but a king of justice.

May he rest in peace. https://t.co/HXD5bqGbnm We can breathe a little easier now, but that's no reason to retreat to the sidelines. All of us must remain engaged in the work of justice.

Change doesn't come from Washington, it comes to Washington. I applaud this move from @JoeBiden. By invoking the Defense Production Act, we can dramatically increase our supply of vaccine materials, testing kits, and PPE.

The President's executive actions are a major step forward in our efforts to finally get this virus under control. https://t.co/QNvp3JHM4L It was deeply reassuring to see Dr. Fauci back in the White House Briefing Room.

Glorious vibes indeed. https://t.co/xMyruCFKB3 I can think of no better leader than @JoeBiden to guide us through these uncertain times.

https://t.co/VtpTYROlmU Donald Trump is the first president in American history to have been impeached twice.

He has brought shame to his office and this nation.

The Vice President has failed to take action and invoke the 25th Amendment.

Now we must move forward in Congress with impeachment and remove the threat posed by this president.

Her resilience and determination is a source of strength for our nation during these challenging times. https://t.co/Xv6g2hYzTk Trump incited a violent insurrection against our own government. Congress should be prepared to impeach &amp; remove the President if the Vice President and Cabinet fail to adhere to their constitutional duty. We must protect our national security. Donald Trump has shown he is a direct threat to the safety and security of Americans and the integrity of our democracy. The Vice President &amp; Cabinet should immediately invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the President from office. Neither the President, nor the members of Congress, nor the violent mobs who want to overturn the results of this election will succeed. 

They will fail. 

Our democracy will not. 

We Shall Overcome. And Donald Trump is being aided and abetted by a group of Republican House and Senate members.

This is on them, as well.

We must rise from this nadir of shame. We must repair our democracy. We must heal our nation. On August 24, 1814, the British stormed our Capitol and set fire to it.

Now the Capitol has again been breached and sieged.

Donald Trump incited this. He is responsible for this. And he is silent as this tragic moment continues. Donald Trump‚Äôs unhinged effort to overturn the Georgia election results¬†is an attempt to disenfranchise millions of Georgia voters.

Today, Georgians can fight back against this lawlessness by electing @ossoff &amp; @ReverendWarnock.

Happy #Easter https://t.co/Czcfh7CAWS Autism touches many families in Arkansas, the U.S. and globally. While each story is different, we know that these men and women ‚Äì and their loved ones ‚Äì are extraordinary people worthy of dignity, acceptance, celebration and love.

My condolences and prayers go out to the entire force, the loved ones of the officer who died in today's attack and for the recovery of the officer who was injured. #GoodFriday is a day for Christians to remember the death of our savior and the hope we now live in because of his sacrifice on our behalf. Today we pause and reflect on God's love for mankind and the work of His son to do the Father's will. https://t.co/w99jHDBCeH The president's so-called #infrastructure plan aims to spend $2 trillion.

via @4029news https://t.co/dKRsQ2HzXi Appreciated the opportunity to visit @CClinicNWA in Springdale yesterday as part of my #ShotsInARms tour. They're doing great work there to get Arkansans vaccinated, including our Marshallese neighbors in NWA.

Check out @KNWAFOX24's coverage‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/1CjoG1SYRT Great wrap-up for #ShotsInARms: visiting @CClinicNWA in Springdale to learn more about its efforts to vaccinate Arkansans + focus on reaching Hispanic and Marshallese populations in the area. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of the hard work being done by so many to get us back to normal. https://t.co/dQEaug3QAv The #ShotsInARms tour continues with a stop by @MercyFortSmith's vaccine clinic.

https://t.co/20wLx8cfDI #ShotsInARms tour continued today with stops in Pine Bluff and Little Rock. It was great to learn about more initiatives to get the COVID-19 vaccines to more Arkansans. These folks are on the front lines of the effort and we‚Äôre grateful for the good job they‚Äôre doing. https://t.co/W0GERgYKjx There‚Äôs a lot in HR 1/S 1 not to like: mandates from Washington on how to run our elections in Arkansas (not what our Founders intended) and it doesn‚Äôt secure our voting system or promote integrity.

Our schools did a great, timely job in reopening safely. 

#ShotsInARms https://t.co/N2hgS7gXH7 .@BaptistHealthAR is helping get #ShotsInARms and has been integral to AR‚Äôs response to the pandemic. It was a pleasure to visit with leaders and staff here to learn more about their efforts and how they‚Äôve worked to provide great care and vaccine opportunities to Arkansans. https://t.co/xSikQL34VQ Now even more Arkansans have the ability to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Let‚Äôs all do our part and help get more #ShotsInARms to get this pandemic behind us and return to normal. https://t.co/XACDAAOb7m Democrats should abandon this attempt to mandate voting rules from Washington, politicize election oversight and bankroll political campaigns. Arkansans can best decide how to run our elections, including how to ensure they are free and fair.

#ElectionIntegrity #ElectionSecurity https://t.co/TSjOhUDXiG HR 1 threatens AR‚Äôs constitutional right to administer our elections. 

Federalizing and nationalizing how we vote is unwise and undermines election security. This bill does it + more, including harming election integrity.

Exciting things are ahead for the program. It‚Äôs a fun time to be a Hog. 

Thank you @RazorbackMBB &amp; @EricPMusselman for giving us a lot to cheer for and get behind. #WPS https://t.co/tbzulfzRwe I'm grateful for @RepWesterman's leadership in the House to ensure Vietnam War-era #veterans who served in Thailand can prove toxic exposure and get the benefits they‚Äôve earned.

Chag Sameach! https://t.co/XaVPYxxLQA .@UArkansas turns 150 years old today. It‚Äôs a special place that has such a tremendous impact on our state. Like so many others, I‚Äôm a proud Razorback who is grateful for all the university‚Äôs contributions and achievements. 

Cheers to more success in the years to come. #UArk150 https://t.co/YOeGLwtIMc Local airports connect our communities. These grants ensure operations continue to run smoothly and help provide a safe environment for travelers and personnel. As we turn the corner on the pandemic, we look forward to seeing travel steadily increase.

https://t.co/8K0bvGBqtM Yesterday Democrats held a hearing on their monstrous 800-page bill to nationalize U.S. elections, so I joined some of my @SenateGOP colleagues to lay out exactly why this power grab is wrong for our country and will lead to chaos in 2022.

https://t.co/UfqkRFp4Fw Today we honor our nation's heroes who have earned the highest award for valor in combat. Only 3,526 Americans have been recognized in this way for going above and beyond the call of duty. We reflect on and are grateful for their service and sacrifice.

#NationalMedalofHonorDay https://t.co/bDpsNs6sUN As @SenateAgGOP leader, I'm sharing feedback from the AR School Nutrition Association at today's Ag Committee hearing on child nutrition reauthorization.

Strict nutrition standards inhibiting the ability to feed kids during a pandemic is a concern we must address. https://t.co/VGcCkL3dvA ICYMI: My SAVE LIVES Act was signed into law yesterday. Now the VA will be able to vaccinate all #veterans, their spouses, caregivers &amp; CHAMPVA recipients. The bill is a direct result of AR veterans sharing their input with me and partnering on a solution.
https://t.co/CIHJ1gxsnv WATCH: @SenTomCotton and I respond to Democratic legislation that would nationalize our elections.

We need to restore faith and confidence in our voting system. This bill does the opposite. Arkansas's top election official told me it would bring chaos. We reject this power-grab. https://t.co/UfqkRFp4Fw NEWS: @POTUS has signed my bipartisan SAVES LIVES Act into law.

The law allows the VA to expand its great work to get shots in the arms of more veterans, their loved ones and caregivers. Arkansans played a direct role in helping make that goal a reality.

https://t.co/sv2jF1RsGF WATCH LIVE as I join my colleagues to discuss election security and integrity https://t.co/5tf6jQGeRU One thing we know for sure: heavy-handed regulation increases costs and drives consolidation.

As @SenateAgGOP leader, I'm committed to preventing planting or market distortion and ensuring programs are fully focused on benefiting producers.

https://t.co/uGpMjyUXuo Happy #NationalAgDay to all the farmers, ranchers and ag producers in Arkansas and across America.

I couldn‚Äôt agree more, President @JoeBiden. .@Malik216_OHIO brings a wealth of knowledge &amp; experience to @OHDems as it begins its next chapter under @lizmwalters' leadership. I‚Äôve seen the high caliber of Malik‚Äôs work firsthand, &amp; I‚Äôm encouraged that Chair Walters has made such an impressive hire right from the start. It's a new day in America &amp; a new day for Ohio Democrats. Congratulations to @Malik216_OHIO, a Team Sherrod alum &amp; the first Black Executive Director of @OHDems! This is a great day for our country, one filled with hope for our future &amp; celebration of what we can achieve together. Their #Inauguration marks the beginning of new leadership committed to healing our country &amp; building it back better so it works for everyone. Joe campaigned as the #DignityofWork candidate, &amp; now, with a Democratic Senate majority, we're going to govern that way. There's so much to celebrate today as @JoeBiden &amp; @KamalaHarris are inaugurated as our next president &amp; vice president.

A record-breaking 81M Americans gave Joe &amp; Kamala a mandate to heal this country, to defeat this pandemic, &amp; to restore people‚Äôs faith in our government.

Congratulations, @lizmwalters and Andre Washington on their elections as the next Chair and Vice Chair of @OHDems. Liz is the right person for the job:

‚úîÔ∏è Has spent her life serving our state and fighting for the Dignity of Work

‚úîÔ∏è Has the experience to field strong candidates who will put working Ohio families first

‚úîÔ∏è Would be the first woman to head the ODP I‚Äôm proud to announce that I‚Äôm endorsing @lizmwalters to serve as the next Chair of @OHDems. @Team_Harbaugh The value I get from listening is from those people in Ohio that are facing problems from COVID or problems with unemployment or problems in their small business. Listening to what the public has to say about the situation and tell the stories that they have in their lives. @Team_Harbaugh I know them well enough to know that they're not all that serious or they're so rigid in their thinking that I'm not going to learn a lot. I listen to everybody on the Senate floor and committee, but some, let's just say, are rather predictable. @Team_Harbaugh Let's just say I more acutely listen to my constituents at a roundtable or at a union hall, than I do Washington politicians who say the same thing over and over. @Team_Harbaugh My job is to fight for workers and fight for jobs and fight for better pay, and fight for people's right to join a union, so they can join the middle class. It's what I do every day in this job, but it's a message that works in every corner of every state in the country. @Team_Harbaugh Elections come down to one question -- who‚Äôs on your side? My job is to show Ohioans I fight for them -- for ALL workers, no matter where they live, what kind of work they do, or whom they voted for. It's really about the Dignity of Work. @JoeBiden won by appealing to workers. Now, it's time to deliver for them by:

‚úîÔ∏è Raising the minimum wage
‚úîÔ∏è Protecting workers on the job
‚úîÔ∏è Passing paid family leave
‚úîÔ∏è Protecting gig economy &amp; contract workers
‚úîÔ∏è Empowering workers with the right to organize ‚ÄúIf even a global pandemic...will not get corporations to rethink their exploitative business model, it‚Äôs time to stop letting them run the economy. They had their chance. They failed.""

P.S. We ‚ù§Ô∏è the @TimsDesiree pin! It feels good to #VOTE knowing that you're playing a role in changing this country. Knowing you can tell your kids and grandkids, ‚ÄòI did this for my country and it mattered and it had an impact.' Think your vote doesn‚Äôt matter?

Think again. The 2016 presidential election came down to less than 80,000 votes in three states. Another reason @JoeBiden is the right choice for workers &amp; unions:

‚úÖ@JoeBiden will put Ohioans to work building things in America.

https://t.co/1g4FPCPHOn Read Sherrod &amp;  Rev. William J. Barber, II full op-ed, ""Why workers will decide the 2020 election"" here: 
https://t.co/m7c7QbNFb8 ""As American workers head to voting booths and mail in ballots in numbers so large they cannot be ignored, they send a clear message to political leaders: we are the backbone of this country, our work has dignity, and you cannot continue to exploit us."" Ohio workers are tough -- we don't need a president who sugarcoats things, we need a president who tells the truth, and empowers us with a plan to get to work to beat this virus, instead of lying about it. That's @JoeBiden.

Watch, share, &amp; #VOTE . - SB https://t.co/aFNpjxqVGo Team Sherrod is here to help!

https://t.co/sxOCOF3dG1 https://t.co/iljl9VXo7W Americans are tired of Trump's phony populism and broken promises. Together we can elect a president who will finally be on workers' side.
https://t.co/JsDqrrBCn7 When Smithfield, a multibillion-dollar corporation owned by the Chinese communist government, failed to protect its workers, Trump handed out a paltry fine of just $10 per worker. Trump attacked Goodyear -- an iconic Akron-based company that employs 64,000 workers -- to fuel his petty political grievances. Trump refuses to raise the minimum wage for workers. Trump and his administration have made it even easier for corporations to bust unions. Trump promised to protect #SocialSecurity and #Medicare but he told his rich friends in Davos he would pay for his corporate tax cuts by cutting Social Security and Medicare, and is gutting them through his latest tax scam, the payroll tax freeze. Trump is trying to use the Supreme Court to eliminate the ACA, taking health coverage away from more than 740,000 Ohioans and putting more than 5 MILLION Ohioans at risk of losing protections for pre-existing conditions. Trump failed to protect essential frontline workers while they put their lives at risk to keep our country going during the pandemic. Trump took away the $600 per week in unemployment insurance for 680,000 Ohioans in the middle of an economic crisis. Almost 1 MILLION Ohio workers lost their jobs because of Trump‚Äôs failure to respond to the pandemic. Trump made it easier for employers to reduce and take away overtime pay from hundreds of thousands of Ohio workers. Trump stacked the courts and the Department of Labor with corporate lawyers who would side with his anti-worker agenda. Trump wasted trillions of workers‚Äô tax dollars on a massive handout to Wall Street and his wealthy friends. In 2016, Trump promised to fight for Ohio workers, but failed to lift a finger when GM abandoned Lordstown, taking 4,500 jobs with it. Before @JoeBiden and President Trump take the debate stage tonight in Cleveland, we‚Äôre counting down Trump‚Äôs worst betrayals of Ohio workers. #Debates2020 ""Biden has become the 'Dignity of Work' candidate Brown has long campaigned as."" https://t.co/hDFfuEw0QN In 2018, Sherrod was re-elected by nearly eight points in Ohio because we talked about the #DignityofWork to voters in every corner of the state. And we showed that you can win in the industrial Midwest without compromising our progressive values. Hey @CoryBooker and @BrianSchatz, I know we can do it!

Every vote matters in battlegrounds like Ohio. If you haven‚Äôt yet, register, request your ballot, and make sure to return it in time to be counted. And then talk to your friends and family about making a plan to vote, too. Joe's tax policy is anchored on the #DignityofWork and includes my plan to expand the Child Tax Credit, which would put money back in the pockets of families during this crisis. üëá https://t.co/V6XqvzNhSU What's the difference between Trump and Joe Biden?

Trump is all about wealth, Joe is all about work. Look at their tax plans:

People do not have to keep dying and we have the power to do something about it. But that can‚Äôt happen until politicians stop working for the NRA and start doing the right thing for the people they serve.

One year ago this week, I joined @nanwhaley after the shooting in #Dayton, Ohio. I looked the President in the eye and urged him to do the right thing. Make no mistake, Ohio IS a battleground.

While attendance will be limited due to current public health guidelines, the hearing will be livestreamed here: https://t.co/VR7Uboyvcw I want to wish a blessed Ramadan to all who will be observing a month of fasting and prayer. https://t.co/6VJLtaeT3P With the 2020 presidential election approaching, it‚Äôs more important than ever that we remain vigilant against the threat of interference from hostile foreign actors. One of the ICA‚Äôs most important conclusions was that Russia‚Äôs aggressive interference efforts should be considered ‚Äòthe new normal.‚Äô
¬†
That warning has been borne out, as Russia and its imitators increasingly use information warfare to sow societal chaos and discord. In reviewing the ICA, the Senate Intelligence Committee looked at two key questions:
¬†
‚ñ™Ô∏èDid the final product meet the initial task given by the President
‚ñ™Ô∏èWas the analysis supported by the intelligence presented?
¬†
We found the ICA met both criteria. Today, the Senate Intel Committee released the fourth and penultimate volume in our bipartisan Russia investigation, which examines the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment that identified Russian election interference: https://t.co/qFa0yKEfZU If you did not file a 2018 or 2019 tax return but do have dependents, register with the IRS by *Wednesday, 4/22 @ 12PM ET* to make sure you automatically receive an additional $500 per eligible child when you receive your $1,200 Economic Impact Payment. https://t.co/A8cpki1gyH Until then, you can #FindYourPark (virtually) from the safety of your own home. 2/2 https://t.co/FyUtG7NLoF #NationalParksWeek is a chance for us to celebrate the beauty of our country and the benefits of smart conservation.

They aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsecretive‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh-dollar donor‚Äù organizations. They‚Äôre great civic institutions that bring people in D.C. together for events, receptions, and lunches.

And they‚Äôre open to anyone who wants to get involved. 3/ This lunch was hosted on Feb. 27 by the North Carolina State Society. It was publicly advertised and widely attended. 

NPR knew, but did not report, that attendees also included many non-members, bipartisan congressional staff, and representatives from the governor‚Äôs office. 2/ In a tabloid-style hit piece today, NPR knowingly and irresponsibly misrepresented a speech I gave last month about the coronavirus threat. 

Let me set the record straight. 1/ As #COVID19 continues to develop, we have 2 critical goals: slow the virus‚Äô spread &amp; provide immediate, targeted relief to those impacted. Today, I voted for the 2nd relief package to help families &amp; small businesses during this unprecedented challenge. https://t.co/4hIuKMLCZQ NC officials are working day and night to keep our communities safe.
 
Yesterday, the @CDCgov awarded NC $13.8 million to help #StopTheSpread of #COVID19. This funding will help increase our ability to test, identify, and track coronavirus cases throughout the state. https://t.co/Ij1qJnrPlR The @WhiteHouse Coronavirus Task Force has issued new guidelines to help slow the spread of #COVID19.
 
The next 15 days are absolutely critical for us to #flattenthecurve.
 
This only works if we all do our part. https://t.co/TXXi6c1EiT If we want to stop the spread of coronavirus, it‚Äôs imperative that low-risk individuals, as well as those that are high-risk, take the following commonsense steps: 
 
‚òëÔ∏èWash your hands with soap and water.
‚òëÔ∏èAvoid touching your face.
‚òëÔ∏èAvoid crowds and large social gatherings. Here is a great visual that explains why social distancing is such an important and effective tool to help us #flattenthecurve and slow the spread of COVID-19: https://t.co/0R7b224kBW The US is a leader in medical innovation, but we must improve drug affordability. That's why Sen. @MikeCrapo and I introduced the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, which brings together strong solutions to tackle high costs without imposing price controls. https://t.co/J2ALRHsuQi https://t.co/gwZx0ePhmZ With today's announcement, make sure you‚Äôre staying up-to-date on #COVID19 recommendations from the @CDCgov  and @ncdhhs. I will continue to work with @NC_Governor and state and local public health officials to ensure they have the resources they need to keep NC communities safe. https://t.co/QsrByPf5DK Our legislation will modernize the approval process at the FDA to allow diagnostic test developers to keep pace with today‚Äôs medical advancements, create tests that discover disease more quickly, and ensure Americans can rely on test results.

Read More ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/uyrlfGxyYH As the number and complexity of diagnostic tests grow in the U.S., it‚Äôs essential we have a regulatory framework that supports innovation and prepares us for the next generation of products.
 
That‚Äôs why today I am introducing the VALID Act with @SenatorBennet. https://t.co/P70yYH6WFB My statement on the first reported case of coronavirus in North Carolina: https://t.co/v1zZ8SlG26 https://t.co/V8zBVWoP7x Thanks to @NOAAFisheries for working with us to allocate over $7.7 million in disaster relief for North Carolina fisheries.

It‚Äôs unfortunate Senate Dems chose to block medical care for babies born alive &amp; a 20-week limit that‚Äôs standard in the rest of the world. IP theft, corporate sabotage, and market manipulation are part of Huawei's core ethos and reflected in every aspect of how it conducts business. Today's announcement by the @EDNYnews is important in combatting Huawei's state-directed, criminal enterprise. https://t.co/2rMGFYwnIY Walter Jones had a lasting impact on NC and this country. He was a dedicated public servant who practiced a steadfast commitment to his principles. I can think of no better way to recognize his legacy than by dedicating the Walter B. Jones Jr. Post Office in his hometown. https://t.co/8cMdYKHdv6 Congress built a strong emergency response framework, designed to be flexible and innovative, so we are not only ready to face the coronavirus today, but new public health threats in the future.
 
Read more: https://t.co/eH344TuPUQ We must continue building on the lessons of 2016 and make sure we have strong response options at the ready.

I hope this Committee‚Äôs bipartisan report will help further the public‚Äôs understanding of the threats we face and the current Administration‚Äôs ability to respond to them. Thankfully, today we are in a better position to identify foreign interference efforts and address vulnerabilities Russia and other hostile foreign actors may seek to exploit. Many of their concerns were understandable. In navigating them, however, Obama officials made decisions that limited their options, including preventing internal information-sharing and siloing cyber and geopolitical threats. Frozen by ‚Äòparalysis of analysis,‚Äô hamstrung by constraints both real and perceived, Obama officials debated courses of action in response to Russian election interference without truly taking one. After discovering the existence, if not the full scope, of Russia‚Äôs election interference efforts, the Obama Administration struggled to determine an appropriate response.
 
NEW -&gt; Read the 3rd chapter in Senate Intel‚Äôs bipartisan Russia investigation: https://t.co/JWKKjDKb1f Today I voted to acquit President Trump on both articles of impeachment.
 
Here is my full statement: https://t.co/GSNMPn5lUy Simply put: Americans are in a better position today than they were 4 years ago thanks to the work of this Administration. Today: 

‚úÖ Americans have more economic opportunities than ever before
‚úÖ The Trump Administration has negotiated 4 trade deals in the last year
‚úÖ More than a fifth of the federal judiciary - 187 qualified judges - have been appointed and confirmed President Trump's address tonight underscored his commitment to delivering commonsense reforms that energize our economy, empower American workers, shape our judiciary, and more. https://t.co/BacTMtR53n While the U.S. must consider its own security and economic priorities, I‚Äôm committed to working with U.S. officials, the U.K., and other allies as we move forward, including by supporting the development of credible alternatives to Huawei. 2/2

MORE: https://t.co/sKxN4KP0bs I‚Äôm deeply troubled by the U.K.'s decision to allow Huawei to build components of its 5G network.

The risks Huawei poses are well-documented and impossible to ignore. Once the door is opened, they may also prove impossible to contain. 1/2 The #2019nCoV outbreak is just one example of why we need to stay vigilant against public health threats.

The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act, signed into law last year, will keep America prepared to respond with innovative countermeasures. https://t.co/9GD1zdSjIJ We will #NeverForget the horrific atrocities committed during the Holocaust.

On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember those who were liberated from Auschwitz on this day, and we honor the memory of the millions more who were brutally killed. https://t.co/rz9LPnzM1D Glad @USDOT is doing something about this. Too many people are fraudulently claiming disability needs to bring any variety of animals on a flight. It‚Äôs not fair to those who do need trained service dogs, other passengers, or the airlines. https://t.co/jay0u8LGmW New profile pic. https://t.co/mvArg4RNar Today we celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
 
Dr. King‚Äôs life‚Äôs work was the undaunted pursuit of justice, fairness, and equality.
 
It‚Äôs work that we strive to continue today, and that we can honor by serving our communities. #MLKDay https://t.co/TA7tuoulKp I was proud to support this landmark trade deal, and I applaud President Trump for negotiating a deal that puts America's and NC's interests first. https://t.co/DJ4rn5t9fI Congress's passage of the USMCA is long-awaited and welcome news for NC's farmers and manufacturers.
 
NC small businesses owners, workers, and farmers rely on free and fair trade to grow their operations, provide for their families, and create more jobs. https://t.co/6oA3SEPdUm More great news for NC: The Army Corps of Engineers announced an additional $15M investment in river basin and beach studies throughout Eastern NC.
 
These studies will give us valuable information on better preventing and mitigating future storm damage.
 
https://t.co/4dhAu0Tkpc The Army Corps of Engineers just announced another $281M to reduce storm damage in NC.
 
So far in 2020:
üí≤237M to Surf City/N. Topsail Beach
üí≤44.5M to Carteret County
üí≤39.6M to Princeville
 
These projects will go a long way in protecting Eastern NC communities. I toured Princeville with Mayor Jones after Hurricane Matthew. It was clear then we needed better infrastructure in place to reduce future storm damage. The Army Corps‚Äô announcement that this is finally happening is very welcome news. https://t.co/rhPXNjBskX Great story from @ap on the nearly $40M going to Princeville, N.C. to elevate highways and install new levees after recent devastating hurricanes: https://t.co/PMGs8uYvVc The Army Corps of Engineers just announced nearly $40M going to Princeville to elevate highways and install levees after recent hurricanes.
 
I‚Äôm glad to see the Administration is prioritizing this critical project: https://t.co/IBH26HlCH7 On #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay, I want to extend my deepest thanks to all our men and women in law enforcement for their continued commitment to keeping our communities and families safe. https://t.co/dSl9yNbZ2i Iran and the Iranian people can now turn away from Soleimani‚Äôs murderous adventurism, redirect the Quds Force‚Äôs money into Iran‚Äôs economy, bring home the troops Soleimani sent abroad, and move forward toward building a more peaceful region. 4/4 Soleimani is also responsible in part for Iran‚Äôs current economic strife, as he put his violent campaigns and the enrichment of the corrupt Quds Force ahead of the interests of the Iranian people. 3/4 Under Soleimani, Iran has become the single most destabilizing force in the Middle East and an exporter of tyranny throughout the region. 

The blood of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis, Yemenis, Syrians, Israelis, and countless others is on his hands. 2/4 Qassem Soleimani was the personification of a state sponsor of terrorism. 

At his direction, hundreds of American servicemen were killed and thousands more injured. 

At his urging, U.S. allies were attacked repeatedly and undermined by Iran‚Äôs Quds Force and their proxies. 1/4 ‚ÄúThen the angel said to them, ‚ÄòDo not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.‚Äô‚Äù
 
Luke 2:10-11 From me and mine, to you and yours! https://t.co/HotWwX3vxA Happy Hanukkah! Brooke and I wish everyone celebrating a blessed holiday season. https://t.co/APwgVrxcKT And North Carolinians continue to benefit from a pro-growth tax system. Over the past year, average personal income in N.C. increased by more than 5%. 2/2 It‚Äôs been nearly 2 years since President Trump‚Äôs tax reform package became law.
 
That‚Äôs 2 years that Americans have been able to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, provide for their families and their future, and participate in our growing economy.  1/2 https://t.co/GqsLIYZJdJ This funding is important - not only because it gives states more resources, but because it reflects an increased focus on protecting our election infrastructure. I‚Äôm proud of the role the Senate Intel Committee has played in highlighting this critical issue. The Senate just approved another $425 million to strengthen election security ahead of the 2020 elections.
 
That makes $805 million sent to states for election security improvements since 2016.‚¨áÔ∏è
https://t.co/S0HURKnT57 Earlier this year, Congress renewed #PAHPA to ensure America remains vigilant against the public health threats we face in the 21st century
 
I‚Äôm proud that the emergency response framework we helped build more than a decade ago is stronger than ever. 2/2 In 2006, Sen. Ted Kennedy and I worked across the aisle to craft a bill that would strengthen America‚Äôs defenses against pandemics and bioterrorism.
 
Today is the 13th anniversary of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (#PAHPA) being signed into law. 1/2 #WrightBrothersDay commemorates the first successful flight of a manned, engine-powered aircraft ‚Äì and the two men who changed history at Kitty Hawk, N.C. with their persistence and ingenuity. North Carolina will always be proud to be #FirstInFlight. https://t.co/L7xU5UEf3V The Senate just passed a significant boost for our Armed Forces. The #FY20NDAA will:
 
‚úîÔ∏èInvest in our Intel Community
‚úîÔ∏èRebuild NC military bases damaged by hurricanes
‚úîÔ∏èModernize our military readiness programs
‚úîÔ∏èProvide a 3.1% pay raise to our troops
 
https://t.co/4bBisGbnA8 https://t.co/L2DNYrodQR Great news: HELP Committee just passed my bipartisan bill to help states meet work requirements for child care employees to better safeguard our children.
 
Next step: The Senate floor.
 
Find out more about this commonsense legislation here: https://t.co/Hkjm7NZfmT I was deeply saddened this week by the news about Pete Frates.
 
Pete was a leader, a fighter, and a fierce advocate for #ALS research. He was also a beloved husband, father, and son.
 
His legacy will live on as we continue fighting for a cure for this devastating disease. https://t.co/cz96OXsXoN Inspector Horowitz‚Äôs report is long and detailed, and I‚Äôm reviewing it carefully. I look forward to releasing the Senate Intelligence Committee‚Äôs counterintelligence report, which will have more to say on these topics. Even now, 78 years later, December 7, 1941 is still a date that lives in infamy.
 
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, a generation of Americans rose to meet the challenge of their time: to defend freedom from tyranny and win the war that came to them. https://t.co/6fpmNxCpd2 https://t.co/PO5lTQQBtp The Senate just confirmed a brilliant legal scholar and dedicated public servant to the bench. Richard Myers is well-qualified, widely respected, and an excellent choice for the Eastern District of North Carolina. https://t.co/z1aDGOBT26 I‚Äôm speaking on the Senate floor now about why we should confirm Professor Richard Myers as a federal judge for the Eastern District of North Carolina.
 
Tune in here: https://t.co/bUaGrc9Wf1 Glad to be part of this bipartisan effort to help preserve America‚Äôs HBCUs.
 
The number one concern for HBCUs is unpredictable funding, but this amendment provides certainty for many years to come. https://t.co/Eqm6vPK5Yr On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we‚Äôre reminded that promoting disability rights is critical not only for Americans here at home, but for millions all over the world. Everyone deserves respect and equal treatment under the law. #IDPWD Wishing everyone a Happy Thanksgiving! As we spend time with our families, let‚Äôs remember to send our thanks and our prayers to the members of our armed forces who can‚Äôt be with their loved ones today. https://t.co/uAU1S023TV Every 65 seconds another American will develop Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.
 
As we continue to fight for a cure to this terrible disease, November is an opportunity to raise awareness of the impact it has on sufferers, caregivers, and families. #AlzheimersDiseaseAwarenessMonth Had a great time joining Charlotte &amp; other friends in celebrating 5 years of the #ABLEAct!

That‚Äôs 5 years that young people with disabilities have been able to save money without losing the benefits they need. https://t.co/Lz58nQgxOl Happy birthday, North Carolina! From the mountains to the sea, you‚Äôll always be the place I‚Äôm proud to call home. #NC230

And our 2nd volume on Russia‚Äôs use of social media ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/dOmE5qTsys One of the biggest shortcomings we identified after 2016 was the lack of communication between federal agencies and states when it comes to election security. This coordinated offense speaks to the lessons we‚Äôve learned and the significant progress we‚Äôve made since then. https://t.co/IeNk7bDaoP @juliuspeppers_ Absolutely. DM me and we‚Äôll set it up.
 
I played D1 football myself (one of only a few former players in the Senate), so I‚Äôm also thinking about this as a former athlete ‚Äî albeit one of the 99% who never went pro. Today, @senjudiciary advanced Prof. Richard Myers' nomination to serve on NC's Eastern District Court. 
 
If you haven't heard Prof. Myers' story, you should. He's a brilliant legal mind, the epitome of the American Dream, and a historic choice for NC. 
 
https://t.co/GTLIk3gHJK If college athletes are going to make money off their likenesses while in school, their scholarships should be treated like income.

Our prayers are with her family. 

My full statement: https://t.co/Byc1Fw4Z8R ISIS fighters should take note that their leader died in a hole, miles away from them, in what he thought was a safe haven. The message is clear. There is no safe haven. 2/2 The U.S. raid against Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi marks an important milestone in the campaign against remaining ISIS leadership. The world is safer without al-Baghdadi in it. 1/2 At great risk, the Montagnards provided critical intelligence and fought alongside our military during the Vietnam War.
Today, North Carolina is home to the largest Montagnard community outside of Vietnam. I'm honored to recognize their heroic contributions and our historic bond. https://t.co/IJC2MHfIPL People and families fighting debilitating diseases like ALS face unexpected challenges.

Christina and @Astro_Jessica have made the country proud, and I hope they will inspire kids everywhere to get involved in STEM programs. 

https://t.co/AdoCiJSoDH Great to see @wnct9 shine a light on Disability Employment Awareness Month. We championed the #ABLEAct so more disabled Americans can pursue jobs that let them use their talents and gives them a sense of purpose. https://t.co/GiIKmxbXhA Very saddened to learn of the passing of Elijah Cummings. My thoughts today are with his family and his many, many friends who will feel this loss deeply. It's clear that if America's networks are not secure, the American people are not secure. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working to prioritize solutions that ensure our nation‚Äôs cyber infrastructure is safe, resilient, and cutting-edge. 2/2 Throughout my time as Chairman of Senate Intel, folks have asked me what I think America‚Äôs top 5 national security priorities are in the 21st Century.
 
The answer is easy. Numbers 1-5 are all cybersecurity. #CybersecurityMonth 1/2 I hope the @LittleLeague Softball World Series Champion Rowan County All-Stars enjoy their visit to The White House today! North Carolina‚Äôs proud of these awesome athletes.

And other adversaries are following suit. 2/ Russia is waging an information warfare campaign against the U.S. that didn‚Äôt start and didn‚Äôt end with the 2016 election. Their goal is to sow societal discord and erode confidence in the machinery of government.

That‚Äôs 144 strong, qualified judges confirmed to the federal bench to preserve the rule of law and uphold our Constitution. #OnThisDay in 1914, #WWI began. It was called the ""war to end all wars,"" but in many ways the first World War was the beginning, not the end, of the struggle for freedom and human rights that has shaped the last century. Twenty-nine years ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law, improving the lives of millions. 
 
We‚Äôve built on the #ADA with laws like the #ABLEAct, which is helping people with disabilities save for their future and reach their full potential. 3/ There has been great progress to improve our election security over the last three years, in part thanks to the Senate Intel Committee's efforts, and it's a testament to what we can accomplish when we give people the opportunity to be part of the solution. 2/ Since 2016, we've learned much more about the nature of Russia's cyber activities and better understand the real and urgent threat they pose. 1/ Today, the Senate Intelligence Committee released its report on election security - the first volume in our bipartisan investigation into Russian interference attempts in the 2016 U.S. elections. Read it here: https://t.co/g65A6048Gz #TeamBurr had a great crop of interns this summer working to help us serve the people of North Carolina while they learned more about government and the legislative process! #NationalInternDay https://t.co/3bbjv7Etdw üëá https://t.co/W7eGznXpHB Today, I voted once again to reauthorize the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.

The #AmericanRescuePlan extends unemployment benefits, provides $1400 stimulus checks, and will help American families as we continue to fight this pandemic. The fight against COVID-19 is not over. The #AmericanRescuePlan provides $20 billion for #COVIDVaccine distribution because that is job one right now: to get the vaccine into the arms of Americans. The #AmericanRescuePlan:
‚úÖExtends unemployment benefits until September 6,
‚úÖContains new support for restaurants &amp; small biz,
‚úÖProvides $1400 stimulus payments to millions of Americans.

It‚Äôs time to get these dollars out the door. The #AmericanRescuePlan provides critical relief for airline workers, pilots, mechanics, &amp; flight attendants who have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis.

This bill is already helping stave off losses in the aviation sector &amp; will make sure we are poised for a strong recovery. https://t.co/jeCxStrZCO https://t.co/ClTbfcFx6a Too many middle-class families struggle to make ends meet and too many people work long hours for too little pay.

That‚Äôs why the #AmericanRescuePlan provides $7 billion to the @FCC for schools and libraries to provide #broadband connectivity to help students learn at home. Women have made great strides in achieving equal opportunity, whether in the boardroom or the halls of Congress. 

This #InternationalWomensDay we celebrate our hard-won and hard-fought progress and acknowledge that we must continue to push boundaries and move forward. From vaccines to stimulus checks to unemployment benefits, the #AmericanRescuePlan will help American families as we continue to fight the COVID pandemic. We must pass this legislation and get these dollars out the door. Our health care workers are working tirelessly, along with other government officials, to get shots in the arms of individuals. That's why the #AmericanRescuePlan is so important. It provides $20 billion to invest in #COVIDVaccine administration and distribution. Job one right now is to get the vaccine into the arms of Americans, but everyone knows that demand far exceeds supply. 

The #AmericanRescuePlan provides $20 billion for #COVIDVaccine distribution to increase the pace of vaccinations.

Last month @PattyMurray and I urged the Biden administration to approve @GovInslee's requests for federal disaster declarations for Malden after the Trump administration refused to act.

We cannot accept the status quo of unequal pay for women. It‚Äôs time for the Senate to end pay discrimination by passing the #PaycheckFairness Act. Achieving pay equity isn‚Äôt just about fairness; it‚Äôs good for the economy and for American families. We must end harassment against AAPI communities. I fully support President Biden‚Äôs recent executive order condemning racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against AAPI communities, and directing federal agencies to counter any anti-Asian bias and discrimination. The federal minimum wage has not been raised since 2009. It‚Äôs long past time American families across the country got a raise.

https://t.co/3cP40IqJh0 Dr. King worked hard to fight for the voting rights that give everyone a voice in our democracy. And today his legacy continues in people like Kamala Harris and Raphael Warnock. But it also continues in all of us if we carry his torch forward &amp; help illuminate the future. #MLKDay We also need to change our approach to youth criminal justice and focus more on investments in education, housing, and public health. I will continue to work with my colleagues to pass these important reforms. Right now we are not upholding the civil liberties of all Americans. We can &amp; must do better. Congress must pass policing reforms, &amp; I‚Äôm proud to cosponsor the #JusticeInPolicingAct that takes important steps like banning chokeholds, no-knock warrants, &amp; discriminatory profiling. Dr. King's leadership inspired a nation. He challenged us to fight discrimination and uphold the civil liberties of all Americans.

My statement on the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2021‚¨áÔ∏è #SaveRoadless #ProtectTheTongass https://t.co/D8jW1ije0i I joined my colleagues in a letter to¬†Secretary Azar about¬†the¬†significant challenges in COVID-19 vaccine distribution &amp;¬†what¬†actions the Trump administration must take to address¬†them.¬†A comprehensive, national plan for vaccines¬†is¬†long-overdue. https://t.co/kH4dEzkcTG I supported impeaching the President before for his misuse of his office. And I will support impeachment again for abusing power and attempting to interfere in the election results in Georgia. My full statement‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/fjLNvhcuge I want to thank everyone who put their safety on the line to keep us safe. There must be accountability, and we must ensure it never happens again. (2/2) Democracy prevails and endures. In the end, Congress respected the will of the American people and upheld the rule of law. I strongly condemn the violence and crimes that were committed today. (1/2) Welcome to Congress, @RepStricklandWA! I know you‚Äôll be a strong advocate for the people of WA-10, and I look forward to working with you in the coming years. https://t.co/bEwmxU02SO Wishing every Washingtonian a safe and happy New Year! It‚Äôs been a difficult year, and as we say goodbye to 2020 and look forward to 2021, let‚Äôs resolve to come together to make the New Year healthier, more prosperous, and more equitable for all. https://t.co/X3gSkrjrln It is critical that we continue to invest in our aging ferry system to move more people and products effectively. The new Mukilteo terminal is a shining example of that investment. https://t.co/lTfTITvXOB Millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet as we continue to fight this pandemic. I urge Leader McConnell to hold a vote on the House-passed legislation that will put $2,000 into people‚Äôs pockets for basic needs. #Pass2K https://t.co/SSd425Ar5O #MerryChristmas to everyone celebrating in Washington and around the country. Wishing you a healthy, safe, and peaceful holiday season. https://t.co/dWxyG34jjO I want to thank Michael Stumo, Nadia Milleron, and all those who lost loved ones in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes. Their help and support in passing this legislation has been critical. I‚Äôve said it before: if we want to be number one in aviation, we have to be number one in aviation safety. This legislation is a big down payment on safety reforms, but this process does not stop here. We need to continue to do more to improve aviation safety and to lead the way. It creates new safety reporting standards and procedures. It prohibits interference with those involved in the certification process. And it includes other critical reforms to make sure the process itself works better. It will put the FAA back in charge of those doing the work of certification. It gets rid of incentives for expediting work. It gives new whistleblower protections. It establishes better accountability for misconduct. https://t.co/edskRJ1bpp The COVID relief bill includes legislation @SenatorWicker and I worked on with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reform the FAA, strengthen oversight of manufacturers &amp; certification, and implement reforms that will help Congress stay on top of critical safety information. The COVID package contains my language to crack down on scams and deceptive practices related to COVID. In Washington alone, consumers have been scammed out of nearly $5 million, and the number is $200 million nationwide since the start of the pandemic. https://t.co/UHeQd914Lf Not only that, this legislation also contains a provision that could help build at least 130,000 new affordable homes over the next decade. Investing in that affordable housing will help us put a roof over people‚Äôs heads and create almost 162,000 new jobs. The legislation we passed includes a one month eviction moratorium and $25 billion for rental assistance, and we will continue to work on these issues. It‚Äôs so important to have these provisions signed into law. We‚Äôre at a point where if we don‚Äôt act on this legislation, many Americans could be left without homes. The lack of affordable housing in our country has been a long-standing crisis, but the COVID pandemic has made it much worse. Local news is so critical, especially during COVID. Our COVID relief legislation will make more small newspapers, broadcasters &amp; radio stations eligible for the PPP so they can keep journalists on payroll and continue to get important local news to people https://t.co/IJEGBYCTcZ The COVID relief package we passed will give $9 billion to the health care providers stretched thin on the front lines of this fight who need all the support we can give them. Employing our best science and mapping technologies will help communities across our state save lives, safeguard property, and improve our emergency planning and response. Six years after the Oso landslide, everyone in the State of Washington remembers the devastating impacts landslides can have. This bill would dramatically increase our use of LIDAR data needed to map, identify, and track #landslide risk areas. https://t.co/WEUCE4HlWn Warmest wishes for a happy and peaceful holiday to all Washingtonians &amp; people around the world who are celebrating the first night of #Hanukkah tonight. https://t.co/8OCEyCY9Zx No one should fear for their safety for participating in our political process. I condemn this attack and call on leaders at every level and from all sides to join me in working to help bring our communities together to end hate. https://t.co/82P88Tood6 Their work is an inspiration to all Americans, which is why I am fighting to pass the @NASA authorization bill through Congress. That bill will authorize NASA‚Äôs Artemis program and the rockets and spacecraft needed to return to the moon. #Artemis @NASAArtemis I‚Äôm thrilled to see Washington‚Äôs own Kayla Barron &amp; Anne McClain named to the @NASAArtemis team working to put the first woman on the moon. These two impressive women will carry on our state‚Äôs long tradition of leadership in the space program. #Artemis @NASA The United States is returning to the moon and the next person to make a historic leap on to the moon‚Äôs surface might be a woman from the State of Washington. #Artemis @NASAArtemis https://t.co/QXg0cW73lr I‚Äôll keep fighting for legislative solutions to address the affordable #housing crisis, like my bipartisan Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act. It would give states more resources to invest in new #affordablehousing &amp; help build 550,000 new units over the next decade. This was true before the pandemic, but the pandemic has made this reality even more acute. Right now, 40% of people are in danger of falling behind on their rent, a situation that could become even more dire as eviction moratoriums expire. We need action to address the #affordablehousing crisis‚Äîthis is a message I hear consistently from every corner of Washington state. 

Millions of Americans struggle to find housing. In too many cases, even where #housing is available, people simply can‚Äôt afford it. [THREAD] And I‚Äôm thrilled that Congress is about to authorize three additional new icebreakers to further strengthen the nation‚Äôs fleet. These much-needed investments in our #Arctic future are great news for Washington and the entire Pacific Northwest. .@USCG intends to homeport the first 3 new heavy icebreakers in Seattle, with the first already under construction &amp; heading to Seattle in 2024. Washington is well-positioned to continue to play a leadership role in Arctic exploration, trade, security, &amp; environmental protection. https://t.co/rGGDFCn5pV Today we honor the memory of the 2,403 Americans who lost their lives in the attack on #PearlHarbor. 

We must never take for granted the sacrifices of those who came before us. #HonorThem https://t.co/bZrw3oCuif We need to keep these important records in the Pacific Northwest. They are essential to our history and must remain readily accessible to the Tribes, historians, &amp; all Washingtonians researching the past.
https://t.co/MqWYwe782H The incoming administration has promised to permanently protect the #ANWR for future generations. Hopefully the courts will overturn this reckless lease sale based on the Interior Department‚Äôs purposeful suppression of science and procedural shortcuts. This lame-duck @Interior attack on our environment ignores the fact that major oil companies are not interested in spending billions for the chance at extracting expensive Arctic oil a decade from now. Every major U.S. bank has vowed to not finance Arctic Refuge development. Six decades after President Eisenhower enacted permanent protections for the irreplaceable Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, President Trump is announcing he will sell the rights to drill and destroy this fragile million year-old ecosystem. [THREAD] https://t.co/18XmvwdUiu Today I joined @RepAdamSmith and other colleagues to request an immediate investigation into recent allegations of violence against detained immigrants &amp; a comprehensive review of the use of solitary confinement at the Northwest Detention Center. https://t.co/35XewSeIhz This week I urged Senate leaders to extend unemployment assistance programs in the next COVID relief package.

Politicizing the independent agency that oversees our elections is just wrong. https://t.co/vxiz2cGa6P The so-called ‚ÄúFor the People Act‚Äù would actually remove access to voting for our service members overseas and West Virginians with disabilities.
¬†
Thanks to @WVsosoffice Mac Warner, voting access in WV has increased in recent years.
¬†
This bill is not right for our state. https://t.co/NIA8vYqBXu Great to have @WVsosoffice Mac Warner in DC today as a part of our @SenateRules panel.

West Virginia has been a leader in election security and accessibility for years.

The misguided For the People Act would place undue burdens on WV that would decrease our state‚Äôs efficiency. https://t.co/0GpPyJts8j 50 years ago, the U.S. Senate passed the 26th Amendment, a big step in making the voting age 18.

WV Sen. Jennings Randolph, whose seat I fill today, introduced the bill, and my father, then Governor of WV, signed the ratification.

Due to my efforts, CBP has &amp; will continue to have a home in #WV. https://t.co/WN0VudAaWK These were the concerns @CBP agents expressed to me while I was at our southern border in El Paso on Friday.

Tune in! üì∫‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/FNrHYmrWCE The lack of border security is clearly fueling the surge of illegal crossings.

Congress has already appropriated $1B toward border infrastructure, but the administration‚Äôs illegal freeze contributes to the problem, not the solution. https://t.co/2AFd0rEGzw Points of entry on our southern border are seeing deadly fentanyl seizures skyrocket.

This crisis is fueling the flow of illegal narcotics into our country &amp; eventually into WV.

 #NeverAgain Today, we come together to remember the horrors of the Holocaust. We commemorate the six million Jews and others who were brutally killed by the Nazis.

https://t.co/hv6rNyJCsp Pleased to see @POTUS revoke the license granted to billionaire Dan Gertler &amp; his companies. This case reinforces the need for the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Reauthorization Act, which I recently introduced w/ @SenatorWicker https://t.co/EDsNvHu0dr Today‚Äôs long-overdue announcement will provide much-needed security for Venezuelan families living in the US that advocates have spent years fighting for. The Biden admin continues to follow through on promises to restore humanity to our immigration system.https://t.co/qDTSmNiDBf On #InternationalWomensDay, I'm proud to announce the Girls LEAD Act with my colleagues @SenatorCollins, @RepDavidTrone, @cathymcmorris. This bill invests in girls' leadership and civic engagement to empower the next generation of leaders worldwide. https://t.co/5VKYVsIgNN On #InternationalWomensDay, we must recognize the women on the frontlines of the #COVID19 crisis - as health care workers, essential workers, educators, researchers, and so much more. Despite the obstacles and risks, women have been among the greatest heroes of this pandemic. In order to fully honor John Lewis' life and legacy, we must do all we can to ensure voting rights are protected. We cannot -- we will not -- allow ongoing attempts at voter suppression and disenfranchisement of communities of color to succeed.  
https://t.co/siBS46iWdp Emergencies like #COVID19 are when government can best bring together the resources that will make a positive difference in people‚Äôs lives. The #AmericanRescuePlan brings concrete relief to our nation at a time we need it most. The #AmericanRescuePlan enjoys bipartisan support among the public with good reason. It will help get #CovidVaccine shots in arms, help frontline workers, families and all sectors of our economy. It will change lives and our economy for the better. https://t.co/ZeeCcKVkz7 I am so proud to be part of the Senate that passed this bold package to deal with #COVID19 and rescue the American economy. https://t.co/X9AKuoXrvY We need to pass the American Rescue Plan as soon as possible. Our small businesses are struggling, and they need our help. I fought to ensure that this package targets relief to vulnerable businesses as they recover during this pandemic. https://t.co/kl6eIqTg70 Click below to learn more about the bill and how it works to hold law enforcement accountable and strengthen enforcement of the right to equal protection under the law‚¨áÔ∏è#ERRPA
https://t.co/WymnHDXD9X Discriminatory profiling unfairly targets individuals because of their race, religion, skin color or country of origin. It‚Äôs wrong, it‚Äôs ineffective, and far too often, it can be deadly. I reintroduced the End Racial and Religious Profiling Act to prohibit this dangerous practice This atrocity must not be ignored, and neither should the Burmese people‚Äôs demands for human rights and freedom. I urge the military to immediately release all those unjustly detained and return the country to democracy. The violence against protestors in Burma must end. I send my condolences to the family and friends of those who have been killed in the protests.
https://t.co/Hxv2FxSlqN NEXT WEEK: I‚Äôm hosting a live stream looking ahead at immigration reform with @KrishVignarajah (@LIRSorg) and Gustavo Torres (@CASAForAll).

Let's finally pass The Background Check Expansion Act to require federal background checks for all gun sales and keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn‚Äôt be able to buy them.
https://t.co/t4bNE04lJd Thank you @POTUS and EU for holding Russia accountable.  Today‚Äôs sanctions on Russia for attempting to assassinate @Navalny with a chemical weapon sends a clear signal to the Putin regime. These actions will not be tolerated. Release @Navalny immediately. https://t.co/5153LkAgig Dr. Cardona understands that getting our kids back to school safely starts by listening to scientists. Putting our kids back in the classroom is critical not only for their learning but their social and emotional well-being. Today, I was proud to vote to place @TeachCardona, a lifelong educator, back in charge of @usedgov. Dr. Cardona will work to invest in our children, support educators, and prioritize the safe reopening of our schools. I urge President @NayibBukele of #ElSalvador to end the promotion of political vitriol &amp; dubious claims of fraud ahead of Sunday's election. We know all too well what can happen when presidents incite violence &amp; sow distrust in institutions.
https://t.co/s0qdUO2eLG I commend @POTUS for putting human rights at the center of US foreign policy &amp; publicly releasing details surrounding Jamal Khashoggi's horrific murder. I urge the admin to apply #GlobalMagnitsky sanctions to hold accountable all responsible for his death.
https://t.co/wtfkB5pg2t As Maryland schools prepare to return to in-person learning, I‚Äôm committed to ensuring that students¬†and educators can be safe and stay healthy. I'm fighting for support for mental health services, academic tutoring &amp; extracurricular activities in the American Rescue Plan. I'm a proud product of Baltimore public schools and this #PublicSchoolsWeek I‚Äôm proud to celebrate the educators and schools working to keep our kids engaged and learning through these challenging times. In 2020, 5.2 million citizens were unable to vote as a result of a conviction. Disenfranchisement disproportionately impacts Black and Latino communities nationwide. Voting is a fundamental right for all Americans. It‚Äôs long past time to end this injustice. I reintroduced the Democracy Restoration Act to restore voting rights to formerly incarcerated citizens. There is no justification for denying people who have paid their dues a voice in our democracy.
https://t.co/x1EbbOlUaV The House has voted. The Senate must now step up and pass the Equality Act to provide unequivocal non-discrimination protections for people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. https://t.co/zdBjBeH5KI Today, @SenStabenow and I introduced a bill to expand access to dental coverage through CHIP. The bill strengthens the safety net for pediatric dental health and works to ensure that all kids have access to quality care regardless of their family‚Äôs income.
https://t.co/jCm8CM4nSj 14 years ago today, 12-year-old Marylander Deamonte Driver died following dental complications that could have been addressed with basic care ‚Äì but his family couldn‚Äôt afford it. His death was tragic &amp; preventable, but for too many low-income families, this risk is far too common Special interest groups should not be able to use dark-money to drown out the voices of the American people. The Senate must pass the #DISCLOSE Act to require groups spending big in our elections to reveal their donors &amp; put the power back in the hands of voters. #transparency To watch visit https://t.co/kSBetVJXpv or youtube‚¨áÔ∏è

Thank you, Dan (@DanRodricks ) https://t.co/6RtVY17shW Everyone who was responsible for the insurrection on Jan. 6 should be held accountable, from those who broke into the US Capitol to Donald Trump, who clearly incited the violence. That is why I voted to convict him today.

My statement:¬†https://t.co/m3CawHaXrO The Senate voted unanimously to award Officer Eugene Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal.  

All of Maryland is proud of Officer Goodman‚Äôs courage and brave service to our nation.
https://t.co/s1QvVGK3ye My resolution in response to the coup affirmed that US support for the people of Burma is bipartisan. The US stands with those in Burma who continuously advocate for greater respect for human rights, for peace in the country, and for a democratic government that represents them. I applaud the Biden administration‚Äôs efforts to hold Burma‚Äôs military leaders accountable. These sanctions show that the US will hold those who threaten democracy and ignore the will of their people responsible for their actions.
https://t.co/XNZoXDHs6m A productive meeting earlier today w/@POTUS &amp; my EPW colleagues @SenatorCarper, @SenCapito, @JimInhofe - the first conversation of many as we tackle our nation‚Äôs infrastructure priorities. Ready to work across the aisle to take on the next big challenge
https://t.co/jwllN4vA4M House Managers are unfolding visceral evidence about Trump‚Äôs incitement and escalation of violence in the Capitol. There‚Äôs no doubt that the insurrection on January 6th was an attack on our democracy. We have a responsibility now to get to the truth and accountability. It's even more clear as we review the footage today that Officer Eugene Goodman‚Äôs bravery saved lives. I'm proud to cosponsor the bill to award him with the Congressional Gold Medal. The Senate and our country owe him an eternal debt. A powerful opening statement from @RepRaskin. His strength and resilience are unmatched. 

January 6 was a difficult day for us all, but his testimony illustrated just how deeply personal the insurrection was and how much is truly at stake. #TeamMaryland As we move forward with our constitutional duties under impeachment, we are still working hard to help Americans recover from #COVID19. As Chair of Small Business Committee, this means getting targeted relief to #SmallBiz owners and those hardest hit by this crisis. #Multitasking https://t.co/ggRk7gkkWN I was pleased to speak with advocates in Maryland today, many of whom have worked on the frontlines keeping residents safe during the pandemic.

Tune in live here: https://t.co/EaVeDZLzvq Getting 100 senators to agree on anything is hard. We voted 100-0 because transparent communication with the public is paramount to wining public trust and increasing vaccinations in communities of color, who have disproportionately borne the burden of the pandemic. #COVID-19 Our amdt will support states in implementing efficient COVID vaccine programs to ensure equitable distribution to all communities. It bolsters state vaccine awareness campaigns to promote evidence-based, scientific information, while dispelling misinformation and disinformation. Trust in the COVID-19 vaccine‚Äôs safety &amp; efficacy is especially critical to overcome challenges in getting the vaccine to Americans.¬†
100 senators came together tonight to support my budget amdt w/@senrobportman b/c we know states cannot do this alone; they need a strong partner Combatting #COVID19 globally requires US leadership here &amp; abroad.

President Biden is fulfilling his campaign promise to reverse the discriminatory policies put in place by his predecessor. The admin recognizes that government-sanctioned discrimination runs counter to our values and our national security. https://t.co/QKNQQdsNt9 Access denied puts women‚Äôs health at risk. On this, the 48th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we must ensure all women have equal access to health care regardless of income, race, and ZIP code. #RoeAnniversary For nearly 50 years, #SCOTUS has upheld the legal precedent of Roe v. Wade. State governments need to stop trying to dictate the medical choices of women. Women‚Äôs access to comprehensive reproductive health services should not be under constant threat. #RoevWade Places that guns absolutely do not belong: schools, libraries, places of worship and the House of Representatives. They don‚Äôt belong in the Senate, either. https://t.co/dr1poZ9oKF When Trump reinstated &amp; expanded the global gag rule, he denied millions of men, women &amp; children worldwide access to lifesaving global health programs. The Biden admin plans to reverse this harmful policy, a win for intl work to improve women‚Äôs health and global health outcomes. https://t.co/8iVVTCqrXD One year ago, Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the #ERA.

Our lives were intertwined, starting with our days together at the University of Maryland Law School and then serving together in the Maryland General Assembly. Myrna and I were privileged to have Mike Miller in our lives¬†for all these years. It will take time for me to process that we have really lost Mike Miller.

We send condolences for the lives lost 11 years ago, and we will continue to support the Haitian people in their desire for a better future. The Justice Department is in good hands with the selection of @VanitaguptaCR as Associate AG and @KristenClarkeJD as Assistant AG for Civil Rights. This team of talented leaders will help restore trust in the independence of our legal system. Had the pleasure of talking w/AG nominee Merrick Garland by phone this weekend on priorities for MD &amp; the US. I'm as confident in his leadership now as I was when we met for his 2015 SCOTUS nomination. @JoeBiden has selected a distinguished jurist &amp; Marylander to serve as AG. https://t.co/clGg1lXS6O The status quo in Yemen is unacceptable. We need a political solution, but designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization will only hurt the Yemeni people.

His service will never be forgotten. All those responsible for this tragedy must be held accountable. https://t.co/rqISSl3Fzp We cannot wait 13 days. President Trump must resign or be removed from office quickly - either through the 25th Amendment or by impeachment - before he does even more damage to our nation. https://t.co/2L9CxOBaSR This violent behavior and blatant disregard of the law can never be normalized in the United States of America. Never. https://t.co/hYPzeILjL8 The Republican enablers who encouraged @POTUS and this insurrection must actively work to calm the crowds and restore order. Words matter and the incendiary language used recently has run counter to the truth and our Constitution. Pouring the gasoline, lighting the match and then praising the firefighters. Really quite unfathomable that this chaos was instigated - encouraged - by the President of the United States. 
@POTUS needs to stop this now. His volatile words started it and he must end it peacefully. https://t.co/wtJFp5tKo6 Our job in Congress today is to fulfill our constitutional duty and tally the electoral count. It is not Congress‚Äô role to overturn the choice of American voters. The courts and more than 155 million voters have decided the outcome. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the election. I‚Äôm looking forward to working with the Biden-Harris administration to raise the score for all #ChesBay health indicators and prioritize our waterways. Challenges this year, especially under the Trump admin, threatened work to improve #ChesBay. But strides in reducing pollution and restoring the oyster population in this @ChesapeakeBay report give me hope that we can move in the right direction. https://t.co/GlvB9dj4iZ Happy New Year to all! 2020 brought much loss and hardship, but I also saw kindness, community &amp; good faith among citizens. I‚Äôm hopeful that this year we'll see good health &amp; prosperity because we'll continue to fight for it and to show up for our neighbors, friends &amp; loved ones. Sharing love and prayers tonight for @RepRaskin and his family. Team Maryland is with you always. Once again, Senator McConnell (@senatemajldr) stands in the way of sending $2000 relief checks to Americans at a time of great need. We can and should get this done today. https://t.co/Uxn2fwqGtW Mitch McConnell (@senatemajldr) is doing all he can to deprive Americans the $2K relief payments Democrats, @POTUS and many Rs agree on. Every move shows he cares more about political theater than really delivering the relief many Americans need to survive https://t.co/6Yz2EnOqYa If you have questions about the vaccine, please review public health resources like the @MDHealthDept guide here: https://t.co/2K1vaxKpRm In 2021 we can look forward to wider distribution of the #COVID19 vaccine ‚Äì especially under the guidance of the new admin. We are so close to getting #COVID19 under control. Until then we must all do our part to stay safe. Follow public health guidance and wear your mask. While we continue to combat this virus we must keep up the basic steps we can take to keep ourselves and our communities safe: wear a mask, maintain six feet of space from people not in your household, and wash your hands frequently. I‚Äôm thinking of the 326,000 Americans lost this year due to #COVID19 and the families ending 2020 without their loved ones. As a community, we must come together now more than ever to spread kindness and support each other through these difficult times. I am very disturbed by the arrest of  @nickopiyo and other prominent human rights defenders in Uganda. The Ugandan government needs to respect their rights to due process and commit to fostering a free, open space for civil society. #FreeNicholasOpiyo"
"Carper, Thomas",SenatorCarper,TomCarperforDE,Delaware,Delaware,Senator," At DOJ, Kristen will use her life-long experience as a civil rights lawyer to protect our voting rights, investigate hate crimes and ensure that our justice system fulfills its promise to deliver justice for all Americans. The Senate must confirm her without delay. Today I had the opportunity to meet with Kristen Clarke, President Biden‚Äôs nominee to be the next Assistant AG at @TheJusticeDept‚Äôs Civil Rights Division. https://t.co/Llw0ikoF9X We have the #AmericanRescuePlan to thank for this good news. This relief package continues to boost our recovery, create jobs and save lives. https://t.co/EiDpIrMwqQ And the Senate is next. The time is now to make #DCStatehood a reality. https://t.co/tETCehhaeF Honored to have the support of @IAFFNewsDesk and @AFGENational on the Federal Firefighter Fairness Act of 2021. Both of these groups represent the hard work our federal firefighters do every day. That's why I'm proud to introduce the Federal Firefighter Fairness Act with @SenatorCollins along with @RepCarbajal in the House - legislation that ensures our federal fighters secure workers‚Äô compensation for diseases contacted from fighting fires. https://t.co/UttW4KHueg Federal firefighters run towards danger to save lives, protect property and safeguard our country‚Äôs public lands. They risk their own safety and deserve the proper support when they contract a disease or illness on the job. One step closer to #DCStatehood. Thank you @EleanorNorton and @RepMaloney for your leadership in the House. 

My bill in the Senate now has 44 cosponsors ‚Äì an all-time record for a DC statehood bill.

It's time to give the over 700,000 DC residents a voice and vote in Congress. https://t.co/82aLXYE916 I‚Äôm so pleased to see @POTUS nominate such outstanding individuals to these top posts at @EPA, especially Michal Freedhoff.

Michal worked for me on @EPWCmte. She has a relentless spirit and tenacious work ethic that is rivaled by few. https://t.co/WmlnTnKxMN The AAPI community has been the target of increased racist and hateful acts of violence. We must stand firm in condemning these heinous acts and work together to address this rise in violence. Congress must act now to help #StopAsianHate and pass this bill. https://t.co/DHu2FPEKmX Brenda Mallory will bring integrity, honor, and humility to the role of @WHCEQ Chair, just as she has done in her decades of public service. I strongly urge each of my colleagues to join me in supporting her confirmation. https://t.co/z6gP5fvYef We simply can‚Äôt continue to respond to the symptoms of irregular migration without addressing the root causes of migration from the Northern Triangle.
 
@VP is tackling these issues head-on and I look forward to working with her on this effort in the months ahead. https://t.co/aAEla9CXRV My surface transportation infrastructure principles:

‚úÖ Our roads, highways, and bridges are in bad shape
‚úÖ Climate change is real
‚úÖ Things worth having are worth paying for
‚úÖ Those who use our roads have a responsibility to pay for them Today, the House @OversightDems will take another step towards #DCStatehood. 

It's past time to live up to our founding father's rallying cry of ""No taxation without representation.""

Let's right this historic wrong and grant #DCStatehood. Today we honor Officer Billy Evans, who died in the line of duty protecting our Capitol. I'm grateful for Officer Evans‚Äô service to our country, dedicating 18 years to the Capitol Police force. My deepest condolences are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time. https://t.co/pR5Jszu09g Today I joined @christianacare's Dr. Janice Nevin, @Delaware_DHSS Sec. Molly Magarik, @ChrisCoons and @RepLBR to announce $16 million from the #AmericanRescuePlan for Delaware's vaccine program. This historic bill is directly helping to put this pandemic behind us for good. https://t.co/OxIDOCnXUv Today I visited the First State Vaccine Clinic and met with Delaware Public Health vaccinators to highlight the good work they do every day to keep the First State safe and healthy. And thanks to funding from the #AmericanRescuePlan, they are able to continue operating. https://t.co/nXJ6b1WOFc This is great news! Nearly 20 percent of Americans are now vaccinated - and that number will continue to grow with @POTUS' goal of making every American eligible for a vaccine by April 19. #GetVaccinated https://t.co/LCikFTfQp7 #HelpIsHere for: 
‚úÖStates
‚úÖLocal Governments
‚úÖTribal Governments and Territories 

Relief from the #AmericanRescuePlan provides billions of dollars to enable them to support the public health response and lay the foundation for a strong and equitable economic recovery. I‚Äôve always believed that the key element to enacting change is good leadership and I‚Äôm hopeful that with @POTUS and @VP at the helm, we can put forward solutions to address root causes and bring renewed and lasting prosperity to the Northern Triangle. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration to focus on solutions, like putting in place experienced Senate-confirmed Ambassadors to Honduras and El Salvador and investing in programs like the Alliance for Prosperity to tackle root causes head-on. This is a challenge we'll continue to face if we don‚Äôt tackle the root causes like crime, poverty, lack of opportunity that compel so many in Central America to make the harrowing journey north. It‚Äôs clear we must work to bring security and economic prosperity to the region. After four years of disastrous policies, @POTUS is rebuilding our asylum system but it's clear we face a humanitarian challenge. We simply can't continue to respond to the symptoms of irregular migration while ignoring the reasons why many families seek refuge in the first place. During our visit, we were briefed on the steps and the whole ‚Äìof ‚Äìgovernment¬†effort the Administration is taking to properly caring for unaccompanied minors, at least 80% percent of whom are coming from Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. This week, @NormaJTorres, @RepLouCorrea, @RepJasonCrow and I traveled to El Paso where we were joined by @RepEscobar to see firsthand the steps the Biden Administration is taking to rebuild our broken immigration and asylum system. https://t.co/rlEfnRYLmw This historic relief package is directly supporting communities in the First State. Relief for our small businesses, non-profits, and countless other industries impacted by the pandemic will help our state #BuildBackBetter - even stronger than before.
¬†
https://t.co/0PPp5TVnRf Our country has long suffered from an epidemic of gun violence. I applaud @POTUS's actions today that will make it harder for guns to end up in the wrong hands. 
 
Now it's time for Congress to act and pass commonsense gun reforms to prevent senseless tragedies. https://t.co/CPYg5l3AxC That's why @SenatorDurbin and I introduced a resolution naming this week Assistant Principals Week. Assistant principals deserve to be recognized and celebrated for the hard work they do every day to enrich communities and improve schools throughout our country. #APWeek2021 In Delaware and across our country, assistant principals play a critical role in helping our students and educators succeed. And when faced with unprecedented challenges over the past year, our schools and students displayed remarkable resilience. Thank you @EPAMichaelRegan for hosting an environmental justice meeting with @SenBooker, @RepBarragan, @RepMcEachin, and me.

It's refreshing to have a leader at @EPA working with us to ease the burdens facing communities of color and disadvantaged communities. https://t.co/1dzdTUkfe5 The ACA continues to protect patients and expand health care access to more Americans each and every day. 

And during this unprecedented pandemic, @POTUS created a special open enrollment period lasting through August 15. Visit https://t.co/qMktwpa9JT today to get covered. https://t.co/5EMjRNc5nc Our beaches in Delaware are some of the most beautiful and popular in the nation. Today, I met with the Delaware Bay Beach Working Group to discuss how we can preserve and protect these beaches in the face of climate change. Since day 1, the Biden Administration has been laser focused on putting this pandemic behind us by working to vaccinate Americans as quickly and safely as possible. They've beat every goal they've set.

Now in just 12 days, every American will be eligible to receive a vaccine. https://t.co/Yb8yyFesAv Addressing environmental justice and inequality must be a key part of any infrastructure package. We can't leave any communities behind as we build for the future. Starting TODAY, all Delawareans ages 16+ are eligible to register for a COVID-19 vaccine. You can join the wait list here: https://t.co/AeKGSJrnUW

TUNE IN:
https://t.co/WxzwewxzJA Delawareans: Are you wondering what is actually in the #AmericanRescuePlan? Look no further! @ChrisCoons, @RepLBR and I answered your questions about how you can benefit from this historic  relief package. 

Watch here‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/FRCvs0Ep7l I am heartbroken by this awful news. As a Congress and a nation we are forever in debt to this fallen officer's service. And as we still learn more about this attack, I am praying for the recovery of the officer still hospitalized. https://t.co/2R9yL9Ly2h It's April 2nd, which means you can take me seriously when I say that it's my favorite month‚Äî#EarthMonth!

What‚Äôs something you are doing this month to be a good steward of our planet? We still have a recovery ahead of us, but with faster vaccine distribution and bold investments, the  #AmericanRescuePlan is boosting small businesses and energizing every corner of our economy. https://t.co/UkJcFbqErF Help for small businesses means help for our economy.¬†The #AmericanRescuePlan provides significant financial relief for small businesses. And I proudly voted to extend PPP to make sure this vital lifeline continues to provide much-needed assistance during this pandemic. Over the past year, Delaware‚Äôs small business owners have fought to stay afloat and preserve jobs in their communities. These businesses are the backbone of our economy and we must ensure they can weather this pandemic. The Paycheck Protection Program will help them do just that. Relief for our small businesses means more than you think. The #AmericanRescuePlan provides much-needed aid for small businesses in order to:

üí∞Help get our economy back on track
üßëüè≠Protect and create jobs
üçΩÔ∏èEnsure mom-and-pop shops can stay open Hey @Amtrak, love the new map. I think you are missing a stop in Wilmington, DE. üòâ https://t.co/4ChM7QEwAv I‚Äôm pleased to see @EPAMichaelRegan keeping his pledge to restore science and transparency at @EPA. Curbing special interests is a key part of getting this agency back on track.
https://t.co/FLgWd6Tbr4 President Biden has spent his career betting on the American worker and the #AmericanJobsPlan is no different. This bold, transformative infrastructure proposal will revitalize our economy and put us on a path towards net-zero emissions. Let's get to work! This week, @POTUS nominated 11 trailblazing, extremely qualified individuals to the federal bench. I commend the Biden Administration for continuing to help ensure that our government - including our court system - reflects our nation's diversity.

https://t.co/1MHhBRSfww With the scheduling of this markup, we are one step closer to righting this historic wrong and living up to our founding fathers‚Äô rallying cry of ‚ÄòNo taxation without representation.' #DCStatehood https://t.co/lqY97VWS8T #HelpIsHere for mom and pop shops in the First State. If you own a small business in Delaware, visit the @SBAgov website today to see if your business qualifies for the Paycheck Protection Program or other programs that offer COVID relief ‚§µÔ∏è
https://t.co/lComuwHL17 Starting on April 6, Delawareans ages 16+ can sign up to get vaccinated-this is good news for our state. 

Today, on National Doctors‚Äô Day, I visited Wilmington 1st Walk-In Care, owned by Taylor Burge and Mbwidiffu Dibal, to thank them for their work in vaccinating our community. https://t.co/CVcXBRWDEd Today, I met with Logan Herring who told me how PPP loans helped him keep his employees at Reach Riverside working for this neighborhood revitalization program. 

Last week, I was proud to vote to extend PPP to help small businesses and non-profits like Reach Riverside stay open. https://t.co/TZLD0y4g1l Hello, clean energy future! I'm so pleased to see the Biden Administration unleashing the economic power of offshore wind to help reduce emissions and create good-paying American jobs.
https://t.co/01x2syFFnR Great to see a leader like Michele Roberts earn a seat at the table as a member of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. I know she will continue to be a voice for environmental justice communities in Delaware and across the country. https://t.co/m0IQtwmsJL Even some of our nation's largest oil and gas companies realize we can't afford more inaction on climate change.

It's time to rise to this challenge by taking actions that will get us to net-zero emissions by 2050. We can create millions of jobs and a more resilient country. One year ago, Congress passed the CARES Act to give much needed initial relief to the American people struggling due to the pandemic.

A year later, #HelpIsHere with the #AmericanRescuePlan. Under @POTUS‚Äô leadership, this pandemic will soon be behind us. Today @goodwillde celebrates 100 years! My wife and I visit Goodwill at least once a month to drop-off items like clothes for those who need it most. They also help with job training across the First State. I'm thankful for the work they do every day to uplift the community. https://t.co/Lt2qX7mttI We shouldn't let this pandemic permanently hold back American leadership in combating the climate crisis.
¬†
I introduced legislation with @SenWhitehouse and @MartinHeinrich that would revive clean energy projects and create good-paying jobs across the country. https://t.co/u84Ylt8K0Y The millions of EVs and fuel cell vehicles on our roads in the next decade will need places to recharge and refuel.

I teamed up with @SenatorBurr, @SenCortezMasto, &amp; @SenStabenow to introduce a bill promoting investments in clean vehicle infrastructure.
https://t.co/NeSa8xGNUZ The basic design of the BEAT disincentives some tax credits, like those that encourage private investment in clean energy projects. So, I asked the witnesses, should the BEAT be rewritten? 
 
Or, to paraphrase Sonny &amp; @cher: üéµShould the BEAT go on?üéµ
 
WATCH‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/CUtk2vDFRK At today's @SenateFinance Committee hearing on US international tax policy, I quoted Sonny &amp; @cher by talking about an issue I think all of us - Democrats, Republicans and industry - can all agree on. That's that the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) needs some reforms. https://t.co/1dYqazWDNW Today, @HSGAC held a hearing with Deanne Criswell, the nominee for @fema Administrator. With decades of experience as a firefighter and as NYC's Commissioner of Emergency Management, she will make an excellent @fema Administrator. The Senate should confirm her swiftly. This bold leadership deployed at agencies across the federal government is saving lives and strengthening our economy every day. @POTUS knows to keep the main thing the main thing, and that's vaccinating Americans. https://t.co/wN2yS4bfGl This is a great day for Delaware‚Äôs recovery. Extending PPP will ensure small businesses can receive assistance with new funding and expanded eligibility from the #AmericanRescuePlan

I remain committed to helping small businesses in the First State make it through this pandemic Join me in wishing the First State National Historic Park a happy 8th birthday!

We can't allow any more crises like Flint and Jackson. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, employing nearly half of America's workers. While they've struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic, #HelpIsHere.

The #AmericanRescuePlan will deliver critical relief for small businesses in Delaware and around the country. As we grapple with the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression, Ms. Tai will work with Congress to advance a trade agenda that uplifts American workers, spurs domestic manufacturing, and improves environmental standards around the world. I‚Äôm proud to support her. We would be lucky to have Katherine Tai, a committed public servant, as our @USTradeRep. She brings decades of trade expertise, years of working in a bipartisan fashion, and as the first woman of color nominated to serve as US Trade Rep, she will make history. https://t.co/WNQVPGNXrE This is a big deal! Over 90 percent of Delaware‚Äôs air pollution comes from sources outside the state. This summer, the people of Delaware will breathe a little easier because of this action by @EPA.

Last night, @POTUS addressed the nation, saying there will be enough vaccines for every adult by the end of May. 

Get vaccinated for your family. For you children. For your grandchildren. And for yourself. This pandemic will soon be behind us. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing ‚Äî nothing ‚Äî we can‚Äôt do when we do it together.‚Äù - @POTUS

That‚Äôs what a true and effective leader sounds like. Americans have suffered an enormous amount over the past year. While so much has been lost, today, Americans should feel hopeful. Under @POTUS‚Äôs leadership we are taking the necessary steps to turn the page on this pandemic and #BuildBackBetter and stronger. Leadership makes all the difference.

With the @EPAMichaelRegan now at the helm, I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll see more good news like this as science once again is the guiding force at the @EPA.
https://t.co/zyRJOgSKbJ @POTUS just signed the #AmericanRescuePlan - delivering much needed relief to Delawareans and the American people.
 
This bill is about getting more Americans vaccinated, safely reopening schools, helping our small businesses, and so much more. 

Help is on its way, America. By lying on a background check, those seeking to do harm can get their hands on deadly weapons. One way to prevent that is by making sure states can use existing laws against those who try to do so.
¬†
Proud to join @ChrisCoons and @JohnCornyn on a bipartisan bill to do just that. https://t.co/EfSXQSv8BZ It's a great day for our planet. Administrator Regan is going restore integrity and morale at @EPA and get the agency back on track. I look forward to working together on addressing our most pressing environmental issues. https://t.co/P9BchowMZs Michael Regan is the kind of person who can help unite us in common purpose as we respond to the climate crisis. He is the right person to lead EPA at this critical moment. #ConfirmClimate This news shows @POTUS' continuous leadership and focus on putting this virus to bed. Vaccinating as many Americans' as quickly and safely as possible is the best way we can put this pandemic behind us. 

There is light at the end of the tunnel - and we will get there together. https://t.co/CcVRGVVO0I We are one step closer to bringing relief to American families. Help is on the way. https://t.co/1gPLUQoxgV As Attorney General, we need Judge Garland, a principled, consensus-building public servant, who will make sure DOJ remains independent.  He will work every day to earn the trust of Americans and restore integrity to @TheJusticeDept. The senate must #ConfirmGarland swiftly. The Trump DOJ broke the longstanding precedent to operate above the political fray.

From trying to take away Americans' health care to overseeing immigration policies that locked children in cages to remaining silent after the murder of George Floyd. 
 
But those days are over. https://t.co/U8kzpwRKeq Today, @HSGAC reported out the nomination of Shalanda Young to be Deputy Director of OMB. Ms. Young is talented, knowledgeable and will bring years of experience from her work on @AppropsDems to her new post. The full Senate should consider her nomination without delay. The recent crisis in Texas is a tragic example of how our electric grid isn‚Äôt prepared for climate-related extreme weather events. This morning, I'm holding a hearing on how we can and must invest in a cleaner, more resilient electric sector. https://t.co/TMH0AljsVy This is great news! The smallest of small businesses in the First State and around the country need our support. Thanks to @POTUS, mom-and-pop shops are getting the resources they need to stay open. https://t.co/vleNWreJyM Elections have consequences for wildlife as well. I am pleased to see @Interior reverse course on the previous administration's effort to weaken the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. There has to be accountability when it comes to protecting bird species.
https://t.co/VzUxLhWnV6 On this #InternationalWomensDay, we honor the countless women who have been fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic since day one in the United States and around the globe. To the health care workers, teachers, grocery store workers and many more ‚Äî ‚Å†we are so grateful. I was proud to vote for the CARES Act which made the Hope Center possible. Today, we celebrate the public servants like my former staffer Carrie and the hardworking folks at the Hope Center who put CARES funds to work to turn this hotel into a warm, safe home for 214 Delawareans. https://t.co/bv9xwJ8J2K Healthier watersheds mean healthier communities.

Thank you @DelRivCoalition for inviting me to discuss my work towards policies that reduce pollution in the Delaware River, rebuff the impacts of climate change, and improve access to clean water. https://t.co/uhNydXEWmz 56 years ago today, John Lewis walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in his life-long fight for civil rights - including the right to vote. 

It‚Äôs no coincidence that today, @POTUS will take action to expand access to voter registration to make it easier - not harder - to vote. I‚Äôm optimistic we will be on the road to recovery soon, but now is not the time to become complacent. This legislation will provide the relief that so many Americans need in the short term so that we can come back stronger than before. We know American families are struggling. Our rescue plan offers targeted direct payments to individuals and families and enhanced unemployment benefits to ensure that the neediest among us get the help that they need to weather this pandemic and emerge on strong footing. Small businesses in Delaware and across the country have been suffering during this pandemic. Thankfully, help is on the way. This package adds an additional $7.25B into PPP and gives another $15B towards Targeted Advance grants to help the hardest-hit small businesses. As a result of this pandemic, too many kids have fallen behind. They need resources to catch up. 
 
That's why I'm proud this package includes funding for robust summer school education and broadband so that all students can access the tools needed for a 21st-century education. Getting more vaccines in more arms is the best thing that we can do to keep ourselves and our communities safe. 
 
The #AmericanRescuePlan will provide significant resources to improve the effective distribution and administration of vaccines across the country. We know that to get our economy back on track, we need to put this pandemic in our rearview mirror and ensure we can get Americans back to work and kids back in the classroom safely. 
 
The #AmericanRescuePlan provide us with resources to help us do just that.‚§µÔ∏è It‚Äôs been a sleepless night in the Senate, but that pales in comparison to what Americans have gone through this past year.

We will continue working until every last vote is cast and we pass the #AmericanRescuePlan. Thanks to the countless Veterans Service Organizations and advocates who have called on Congress to close the 90/10 loophole over the past decade. Bravo Zulu! @AmericanLegion, @GIBillRights, @iava, @MilitaryOfficer, @studentvets,  @TAPSorg, @VFWHQ and @VVAmerica My bipartisan amendment to the #AmericanRescuePlan with Senator @JerryMoran closes the 90/10 loophole, protects our student veterans, and gives Congress time to work alongside veteran groups on a lasting solution that works best for our veterans and taxpayers. For too long, bad-actors in the for-profit college sector have exploited the 90/10 loophole and taken advantage of military and veteran students for their generous GI Bill benefits. 
 
Today, after a decade-long call, the Senate is taking steps to close this loophole. https://t.co/lx1DDPHQXK That's why today, I reintroduced The Treat and Reduce Obesity Act with Senator @BillCassidy. This common sense, bipartisan legislation would unleash federal Medicare dollars towards obesity treatments to help millions of Americans lead longer and healthier lives. The epidemic of obesity is hurting far too many families all across our country. More than 40 percent of Americans suffer from obesity, making them more vulnerable to conditions like diabetes, heart disease and others - which are even more dangerous during a global pandemic. On National #SlamTheScam day, here are some key scam awareness tips to remember:

It‚Äôs time to pass common-sense reforms like the Background Check Expansion Act - which will strengthen background checks for gun sales and help keep firearms out of criminal hands. https://t.co/LDNZ74bVbx The House just passed the #ForThePeople Act - landmark legislation that reduces the role of money in politics and returns power to the people by making it easier - not harder - to vote.

This is about preserving our democracy. It‚Äôs time to bring it up and pass it in the Senate. https://t.co/f4HZ6yE59p This #WorldWildlifeDay, I introduced legislation with @senrobportman that combines two of my favorite things: wildlife conservation and @USPS. I hope this bill reaches @POTUS' desk in short order so we can ensure all 45 million stamps are sold to help combat biodiversity threats. https://t.co/dVTzQqMPAv Cyclists know this better than most: Poor infrastructure can be pretty easy to notice. Thank you @BikeLeague for inviting me to speak at #BikeSummit21. I'm working hard in Congress to make our roads safer and more suitable for biking. https://t.co/V9IjuQQXiG President Biden has nominated two supremely-qualified women to serve in roles that will be critical to implementing his climate agenda. I look forward to hearing from both of them this morning. https://t.co/ibZmMeZIRA Good morning! Friendly reminder this pandemic is not over!

Every day we are making progress and putting more vaccines into the arms of Americans. But now is not the time to relax commonsense measures like mask mandates. We need to use every tool to stop the spread and save lives At the start of every Congress, @HSGAC hears from @USGAO to get an update on federal programs at risk of waste, fraud and abuse. 
 
I want to thank Comptroller Gene Dodaro for his testimony and for GAO‚Äôs work to address critical issues. After four years of an AG who served the interests of the former President rather than the American people, Judge Garland is the AG Americans deserve. I know he will be independent and restore trust and morale at @TheJusticeDept. The Senate must move to confirm him swiftly. https://t.co/OJyx9m5NJa ""We should allow each unique community to develop unique solutions according to unique local preferences, and leave it at that."" 
 
Those are Senator Lee's words on the importance of local governance. I could not agree more. Let's make #DCStatehood a reality. Today, @SenMikeLee tried to overturn a local law passed by the duly elected @councilofdc. I objected. 

It was an exercise in federal overreach and a reminder of why it's critical to grant #DCStatehood. It's time to give DC residents the representation they deserve in Congress. https://t.co/4id0lMkvbN Voting is a sacred right.

That's why I'm proud to support the #DISCLOSE Act - legislation that would implement commonsense political spending reforms and restore trust back into our political system https://t.co/jHnYWdq3KN I‚Äôm also encouraged to hear that the Administration still intends on reviewing and updating the social cost of carbon. Americans are already paying for the costs of inaction on climate change. Science-based updates will get us closer to understanding the real costs.

This is another example of the Biden Administration following through on its commitment to making climate change and scientific integrity a priority in every federal action it takes. ‚§µÔ∏è

Today, the House passed the #EqualityAct - an important first step to ensuring our LGBTQ+ community is protected from discrimination in housing, in the workplace and more. 

Now it‚Äôs time for the Senate to act and pass the #EqualityAct. https://t.co/AYl2SqxI5t This announcement from @POTUS will help provide assistance to our smallest businesses that need help the most right now.

"Casey, Robert, Jr.",SenBobCasey,Bob_Casey,Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,Senator," This is a relief plan.¬† It‚Äôs not just saving families from a burning house ‚Äì it‚Äôs a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help rebuild the house. Strong infrastructure is the foundation for equal opportunity &amp; participation in our country.

We have to do this. #AmericanJobsPlan https://t.co/wjA1MQj5JK The #ERA is about basic justice for women. Ensuring that women have equal rights is just common sense and long overdue. 

It‚Äôs far past time to ensure the Equal Rights Amendment is a part of our Constitution. https://t.co/xWr129uUxX This legislation would put money back in the pockets of working families by reinstating deductions for union dues and other unreimbursed employee expenses. Unions are the backbone of the middle class, supporting workers, wage growth &amp; fair economic conditions. 

In 2017, Republicans eliminated these important tax deductions for workers and instead gave massive tax cuts for large, profitable corporations. I'm joining @SenSchumer, @PattyMurray, @SenSherrodBrown, &amp; @RepConorLamb to introduce the Tax Fairness for Workers Act. This bill makes the tax deduction for union dues available to everyone &amp; reinstates the deduction for unreimbursed employee expenses. https://t.co/UtSNdYaBE2 .@POTUS and Democrats have called for $50 billion per year towards care for seniors &amp; people with disabilities.

By comparison, Republicans passed massive tax cuts for millionaires and large corporations in 2017 that come out to $36 billion a year. The Junk Plan Accountability and Disclosure Act would:

üîπStrengthen FTC authority to take action against misleading ads
üîπRequire junk plans to provide warnings to consumers
üîπRequire junk plans to issue annual, detailed reports

‚Ä¶and more: https://t.co/L1HsDmrxJp Congress must ensure consumers are not being deceived by false advertisements &amp; purchasing junk health plans that don't meet their needs.

That‚Äôs why I joined @SenatorBaldwin &amp; @SenStabenow to introduce the Junk Plan Accountability and Disclosure Act https://t.co/L1HsDmrxJp Home and community-based care is infrastructure.

Pass it on. #AmericanJobsPlan https://t.co/Sj5hv3r7fb The #AmericanJobsPlan would help coal-dependent communities diversify and revitalize their economies through innovative energy projects and economic incentives. https://t.co/OPdyPdZtSu These bills would help eliminate the challenges that many former foster youth face in accessing Medicaid coverage until age 26. 

We must do everything we can to support young adults, who have nowhere else to turn, so that they have the opportunity to thrive in adulthood. Congress has an obligation to ensure young adults who have aged out of the foster care system have the same guarantee of health insurance as those who can stay on their parents' plan until age 26. Many former foster youth haves specific health care needs that are well beyond those of the general population. While Medicaid provides critical coverage for children and youth in foster care, their health needs do not end when they age out of the system at 18. Today, I introduced 2 bills that would ensure that youth who age out of the foster care system have health insurance coverage until age 26 (similar to those who remain on their parent's insurance) https://t.co/8tpUPFPLZz.

The question is: When will Republicans in Washington recognize the essential labor of those (mostly women of color) who keep our economy running? #AmericanJobsPlan The $400 billion for home care in @POTUS' #AmericanJobsPlan will make it possible for hundreds of thousands of older adults &amp; people with disabilities to live in their homes, with their families, while receiving the support &amp; quality care they need. Daunte Wright‚Äôs life mattered. His death is inexcusable. We need police reform. Now. Building roads and bridges is infrastructure. 

So is home care.

I'm ready to work with my Republican colleagues, but should the 60-vote rule (filibuster) continue to be abused against widely popular policies, then we must eliminate ‚Äì or at the very least reform ‚Äì the filibuster. The right to vote is under a kind of assault we haven‚Äôt seen since the Jim Crow era‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs going to get worse unless the Senate acts.

Because Donald Trump and his Republican enablers refused to accept the results of a free, fair, and secure election.

They chose the Big Lie and authoritarianism over democracy.

We're at an inflection point in our history and the choice couldn't be clearer. The right to vote is not partisan. Calling legislation designed to protect it a ""power grab"" is insulting to the civil rights leaders &amp; activists who were beaten &amp; killed defending it.

https://t.co/ltiZQib7mW You can walk, run or ride your bike for any distance you want, and go to https://t.co/fRcYO3Dwbl to log your miles and share your participation on social media with #SUDCAwareness. Your participation in raising awareness could mean saving a life. We can all do our part to raise awareness of SUDC. To finish out the month, SUDC families, friends and supporters set a goal to ""stride"" 1,000 miles in memory of the over 1,000 families worldwide the SUDC Foundation supports. Scarlett‚Äôs Sunshine Act will also help support local efforts to conduct infant and child death reviews and promote safe sleep practices for infants. My bill, the Scarlett‚Äôs Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act, was signed into law last December. Named for Scarlett Lillian Pauley, this legislation provides grants for states, municipalities &amp; nonprofits to improve data collection &amp; death scene investigations related to SUDC. March is Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood (SUDC) Awareness Month. We must do more to learn why certain infants and young children have died unexpectedly. Raising awareness of the deaths that remain unexplained could save lives. The fight for health care for all was and is a mission worthy of a great Nation. For states that have not expanded their Medicaid program under the ACA, the ARP provides an incentive by increasing federal support for 2 years if they expand Medicaid. This means more families will have quality, affordable coverage through Medicaid. This investment will provide a larger subsidy for those who are already eligible &amp; expand the subsidy to more middle class families that did not previously qualify for help w/ their premiums. This means more people will be able to afford comprehensive coverage through an ACA plan We fought to include important first steps in the American Recovery Plan. Over the next 2 years, the ARP will invest roughly $35 billion in the ACA‚Äôs monthly assistance for health insurance premiums. And, every Republican politician in Congress voted against reducing health care costs for middle class families through the ACA. Reminder: all the right wing politicians who told you 11 years ago that passing the ACA would result in all manner of catastrophes were wrong. They were wrong then and they‚Äôre wrong now about policies that help lift up hardworking people. The Affordable Care Act is 11 years old today! It put in place consumer protections for all, helped hardworking families get health insurance and expanded Medicaid. It works and now we need to build on it. We must also debate and vote on bills like the one that @RepDwightEvans and I lead, the Resources for Victims of Gun Violence Act, to ensure that we are supporting the survivors left in the wake of gun violence. We must debate and vote on common sense bills that the majority of Americans support, like universal background checks, to finally address and prevent this senseless violence. I applaud @SenatorDurbin and @JudiciaryDems for holding a tragically timely and necessary hearing this morning on common sense gun violence prevention. #EndGunViolence In the midst of soaring gun violence across our Nation, including in Philadelphia, and in the aftermath of the tragedies in Atlanta and Boulder, I am proud that Democrats are finally able to take the lead to ensure that we finally confront the gun violence crisis in our Nation. This uniquely American problem of gun violence has ravaged our streets, parks, churches and businesses for far too long. Unfortunately, my Republican colleagues have refused to even let us debate, let alone vote, on common sense gun violence prevention measures. My heart also breaks for the families who have to live with the pain of this public health crisis of gun violence every day. In Philadelphia, after a record breaking year of gun violence in 2020, the city has already seen a 28% increase in homicides from the same time last year. My heart breaks for the families in Colorado impacted by this violence. I send my condolences to the families of Officer Eric Talley, Denny Strong, Neven Stanisic, Rikki Olds, Tralona Bartkowiak, Suzanne Fountain, Teri Leiker, Kevin Mahoney, Lynn Murray &amp; Jody Waters. As we mourn yesterday‚Äôs events in Boulder, we are reminded again of the tragedy of the gun violence epidemic that plagues communities across the U.S. The police departments employing these individuals should investigate and hold them accountable. The AP story demonstrates why we need substantial reform in policing. The comments by dozens of members in this Facebook group, as reported by the AP, are offensive and disturbing. The examples highlighted in the AP report exhibit racism and transphobia. 
https://t.co/ZPRdBtWlIb @USDA‚Äôs quick action to increase SNAP benefits will provide much needed assistance for PA families.  The American Rescue Plan provides resources to address the economic crisis, feed hungry families and invest in small businesses through the additional SNAP purchases. https://t.co/3Q9Nz2FBM8 Today, @OversightDems held a hearing on #DCStatehood. #DCStatehood means full representation of the 700,000+ residents ‚Äì majority Black and Brown voters ‚Äì in our Nation‚Äôs capital. That is why I am proud to support #S51 to made DC #51. WATCH LIVE @SenateAging hearing on the one year mark of the COVID-19 pandemic https://t.co/VgpIOiMpzw The American Rescue Plan has brought us one step closer to building back better and preventing the loss of more lives. Congress must work to ensure that it is fully implemented and make further investments in health care, HCBS and nursing home safety. @SenateAgingGOP @SenatorTimScott and I look forward to holding the first hearing of the Aging Committee this Congress and hearing from key voices in the aging and disability communities. One year into the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus has claimed the lives of more than 536,000 Americans. Today, @SenateAging will examine how older Americans, people with disabilities and communities of color are faring and what more can be done to help these communities. Thank you to the 88 and counting members of the PA National Guard, who are working at vaccination clinics in the Commonwealth, getting PA teachers vaccinated and ready to reenter classrooms safely. Pleased that the USPS Inspector General will conduct an audit of the Lehigh Valley facility after @RepSusanWild &amp; I pushed for answers. I will keep advocating for changes until Pennsylvanians once again receive their bills, prescriptions, packages and other mail without delay. https://t.co/OuNTrytuJc The Civil Rights Act is a sacred pillar of freedom in our country and we must extend its protections to ALL Americans. The Equality Act is our opportunity to reaffirm the dignity of all Americans and to advance the future of justice for all. #EqualityActNOW Today, I'm re-introducing the Nursing Home Reform Modernization Act with @SenToomey to enhance accountability among the Nation‚Äôs poorest performing nursing homes. We have an imperative to help nursing home residents and workers amid this public health crisis. Since the first outbreak of COVID-19 at a nursing home, more than 178,000 residents and workers in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have died from the virus. As we condemn the recent rise in anti-Asian violence, we must also acknowledge the long history of racism &amp; hate directed towards Asian Americans in our country. The Senate must meet this moment with action to #DisarmHate and eradicate the extremism fueling this hateful violence. This past year, according to @StopAAPIHate, there have been nearly 3800 reports of anti-AAPI hate incidents in the United States. We must stand with the AAPI community shoulder to shoulder in solidarity at this time. My heart goes out to all those impacted by the shooting that claimed 8 lives‚Äî6 of whom were Asian American women‚Äîlast night in Atlanta. There is a wave of anti-Asian hate and violence sweeping our country. It must stop and all public officials have an obligation to condemn it. Congress must work to ensure that the American Rescue Plan is fully implemented and supported by additional measures to help working families recover from the effects of this public health crisis and build back better than ever. This historic legislation will put more money in the pockets of working families, help children return to school safely, ensure everyone who wants to be can be vaccinated, and help our Nation put this vicious virus behind us. While Senate votes and committee hearings have kept me in Washington today, I‚Äôm pleased to welcome President Biden back to Pennsylvania as he visits Delaware County to highlight the transformative benefits of the American Rescue Plan. Wall Street hedge funds have no place in Lehigh Valley newsrooms. I stand with the Guild as they fight to keep the Morning Call in the hands of the Lehigh Valley community. Reliable local news is essential to the Lehigh Valley and communities everywhere, especially during times of crisis. I support the Morning Call Guild in their efforts to preserve high-quality, local journalism at the Morning Call. It‚Äôs been one year since Breonna Taylor was murdered in her home. As we remember her life, we must also work to make change by passing legislation, like the Justice in Policing Act and other measures, in order to ensure equal justice under law for all Americans. My bill, the Disability Employment Incentive Act, will support Americans with disabilities by offering tax credits to employers that hire and retain these workers and that make improvements to the accessibility of their physical and digital workspaces. https://t.co/y1fND6Jwkx Employees and their employers need support, but as in every other aspect of COVID response, we cannot fail to include and support Americans with disabilities in these plans. As we begin to recover from the economic impact of COVID-19, Americans with disabilities have returned to the workforce at a significantly slower rate than people without disabilities, and their overall employment numbers are still half those of Americans without disabilities. President Biden signed the #AmericanRescuePlan today and we are one step closer to putting the virus behind us. This historic legislation will put more money in the pockets of working families, help children return to school safely &amp; ensure everyone who wants to can be vaccinated That is why I will be reintroducing the Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act, which provides vital services for survivors, particularly those from underserved communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, seniors and youth. According to the @WHO, ‚Äú1 in 3 women‚Ä¶are subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence from a non-partner.‚Äù This is inexcusable and we must end this epidemic of abuse in our communities.
https://t.co/LKlyDYZ4Ol Thanks to @TheArcUS and all people with disabilities who advocated for a year to secure dedicated home and community based services to address the ravages of the pandemic on people with disabilities and their loved ones. https://t.co/vUKFVboaRb Judge Merrick Garland will restore integrity to the Justice Department and will be the American people‚Äôs lawyers. I look forward to voting to confirm his appointment. @JudiciaryDems #ConfirmGarland The next time Republicans tell you they‚Äôre the party of the working class, remember what they did, not what they say. Thankfully, the #AmericanRescuePlan provides a lifeline to Americans who were passed over by the GOP's tax scheme. https://t.co/SJo7sg6Cln In case you were wondering why Senate Republicans universally opposed the American Rescue Plan‚Ä¶. https://t.co/El2a0tNwfu Passing the PRO Act is about justice and we must get it done. Today the Biden Administration made it official White House policy to support the PRO Act. I‚Äôm proud to be an original co-sponsor of this legislation, which will strengthen the rights of workers to form unions and advocate for basic rights. https://t.co/zLCVhFFBBB Those of us in public office have an obligation to advance the cause of equal rights, justice and representation for women in America and in communities throughout the globe. Women all across the world are working to drive change and improve our society. As we mark #InternationalWomensDay , let us pause to reflect on the contributions being made by women to our lives, our institutions and our society. When the House passes the American Rescue Plan and sends it to President Biden‚Äôs desk, we will put more money in the pockets of working families, help our children return to school safely and ensure everyone who wants to can be vaccinated. Now that the Senate has passed the American Rescue Plan, the country is one step closer to putting the virus behind us. Good morning, we are going to deliver for the American people and pass the American Rescue Plan, no matter how long it takes What he said. https://t.co/BedV6bylMF Survivors of gun violence need support to recover from the trauma of gun violence, a public health epidemic in this country. I thank @RepDwightEvans for leading this effort with me and look forward to partnering with the White House on this critically important issue. https://t.co/SLVYrpEh8k People w/ disabilities are disproportionately affected by COVID, including losing jobs at a greater rate than the general public. The American Rescue Plan will provide over $9 billion for home &amp; community based services. Let‚Äôs get this done! https://t.co/po3K7mPbYA We need to get this done right now, without delay. I will be voting to defeat poison pill amendments that are only designed to create false political ads and delay critically needed relief. Passing this legislation will get money in Americans‚Äô pockets, vaccines in their arms and their kids back to school. As the Senate considers the American Rescue Plan, we‚Äôre going to see Republicans attempt to derail the relief that the American people desperately need with BS amendment votes. I won‚Äôt fall for it and play their game. The Administration's actions are an important first step. Next, Congress needs to pass the American Rescue Plan and act to provide much needed relief and certainty for families facing food insecurity. https://t.co/EZ6oWGyyBb Today I met w/ Puerto Rican Gov. Pierluisi to discuss the American Rescue Plan and the importance of ensuring that it works for Puerto Rico, as well as concerns shared by the 490,000+ people of Puerto Rican descent who live in PA. I look forward to working with him in the future. I commend the Administration for putting forward a trade agenda that supports workers so we can build back better. I look forward to working with USTR to advance the rights of workers and women as part of our national trade strategy. https://t.co/yC8Gpd5BJd Additionally, this change will include a ‚Äúcommitment to restore U.S. global leadership on critical matters like combatting forced labor and exploitative labor conditions, corruption, and discrimination against women and minorities around the world.‚Äù @UStradeRep released the President‚Äôs trade agenda, which includes my &amp; @SenCortezMasto's proposal to advance women‚Äôs economic empowerment in trade. It will review trade programs to evaluate whether they lead to the economic empowerment of women and underrepresented communities The next step is to permanently close the center so that no future family or child is forced to go through what these families have endured. I am pleased that all the families held on the Berks detention facility have been released. This is a long overdue step to deliver justice to vulnerable migrant families, including children. https://t.co/4HqSWbU830 Great point, @brianschatz. Democrats are working to cut child poverty in half and we should talk about that more. https://t.co/zmcERDWHY5 LGBTQ+ adults face a lifetime of discrimination, resulting in higher poverty and increased health risks in old age. I applaud the PA Department of Aging's move to recognize LGBTQ+ older adults as a population of ‚Äúgreatest social need‚Äù under the Older Americans Act. I would also like to thank Rev. Bill Moore, Kathrine Ermeus, Tamir Harper and The Village of Arts and Humanities for their meaningful contributions to the program. I want to once again express my gratitude to our honorees ‚Äì Glynis Johns, Justan Parker Fields and Dr. Ala Stanford ‚Äì for their leadership and their contributions to our Commonwealth, and to Lynne Hayes-Freeland of KDKA for hosting this year‚Äôs celebration. Thank you to everyone who attended today‚Äôs virtual celebration of Black History Month, ‚ÄúBending the Arc: Celebrating Catalysts for Change‚Äù and joined our discussion about justice, equality and how we all can be catalysts for change. https://t.co/YwnRw6Tm1R"

Joe Biden just said that he would destroy all the oil and gas related jobs in Louisiana. Under Republican leadership, we are lowering emissions by using cleaner burning Louisiana natural gas. Biden and the Left would destroy our economy and send our jobs overseas to dirtier producing countries like China and increase global emissions. #Debates2020 @RealDonaldTrump has been working to get real relief for struggling Americans, but the Democrats continue to obstruct these efforts.

The #CORPSAct will strengthen the education award &amp; benefits members receive &amp; create even more opportunities for Americans to give back. Vanita Gupta is a consensus builder who always seeks to find common ground ‚Äì making her just the type of leader needed in the Justice Department today. #ConfirmGupta https://t.co/b3Ao67JSVi Today, @SenatorWicker and I, along with more than a dozen of our colleagues, reintroduced the bipartisan #CORPSAct‚Äîa plan to boost the ranks of @AmeriCorps to help us recover from the pandemic and build back stronger than ever. https://t.co/NGOZvs6iXO The point of democracy is not just to participate in politics, but also to make progress. 

A $1B annual investment in civics &amp; history education through our Civics Secures Democracy Act will allow future generations to do just that. 

More w/ @JohnCornyn: https://t.co/tF1uBAbDvW I‚Äôll be voting for the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to #StopAsianHate. This bill would expedite the review of reported hate crimes &amp; work to combat discrimination related to the pandemic. 

We cannot stand by while bigotry &amp; hate continue to plague our nation. I look forward to working with the Biden administration, our NATO allies, the Afghan government, and other partners to implement a safe, responsible draw down and to support the ongoing peace process in Afghanistan through diplomatic means. I‚Äôm confident that @POTUS and his team conducted a thorough assessment of the challenges we face, realistically weighed the options, and concluded that the best way to protect the American people and advance our interests is to bring our remaining troops home from Afghanistan. In the meantime, China has ascended to be a near-peer competitor, Russia is emboldened and staging cyber-attacks on our own democratic institutions, and climate change and global health have become pressing national security challenges. In the last 20 years, the world has changed dramatically. 

U.S. troops have fought bravely in Afghanistan. Over 2K U.S. &amp; allied troops have made the ultimate sacrifice. We have invested billions into training Afghan Security Forces and stabilizing the Afghan government. Unlike the former President, who abruptly decided to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan without consulting our allies and partners, President Biden has spoken at length with our NATO allies and other partners and met with military, intelligence, and diplomatic advisors. I‚Äôve heard from hundreds of Delawareans who are tired of the seemingly endless war in Afghanistan, and for good reason. 

They want to see our troops come home. As @POTUS addresses the nation to announce the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and an end to America‚Äôs longest war, I‚Äôd like to offer a few thoughts: I remain focused on the crisis in Ethiopia‚Äôs Tigray region. Prime Minister Abiy has made important commitments on humanitarian access, accountability for human rights abuses, the removal of Eritrean troops, &amp; other regional challenges. I am looking for action on his commitments. https://t.co/rpsoYFrB2a The United States must continue to speak out against the PRC‚Äôs human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and we must also provide assurance and protection for the Uyghurs and all those facing persecution as a result of their religious or ethnic identity. https://t.co/VMcA9ogbn5 Daunte Wright was a son, brother &amp; father who should be alive today. My heart is with his family as they grieve an unimaginable loss. Too many families in Black America have endured this pain. We need a thorough investigation &amp; meaningful reforms to build trust &amp; ensure justice. I thank my friend @chefjoseandres and @WCKitchen for being here at the Capitol today to serve food, which always has a way of bringing us together ‚Äì particularly during difficult times. https://t.co/1WkxN9Fsiy I am deeply grateful for all of the Capitol Police officers who continue to keep us safe in the face of tragic losses and enormous stress. My prayers are with the family of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Billy Evans, his friends, and fellow USCP officers. We will never forget Officer Evans‚Äô heroism, his dedication over 18 years on the force &amp; his sacrifice, for which we owe a debt of gratitude that cannot be repaid. I'm determined to expand the reach of NSF this year because more research = faster economic growth, more well-paying jobs, and better living standards for all Americans. Elevating NSF is a goal I've worked toward through my Innovation Centers Acceleration Act with @SenatorDurbin, that Senate colleagues have pushed in their Endless Frontiers Act, and that @POTUS backs in his American Jobs Plan. Today @NSF Director @DrPanch testified in the Senate about the remarkable potential for American innovation‚Äîif Congress amplifies support for groundbreaking NSF research across the spectrum of science, engineering, and technology. https://t.co/Hi6BPcNEEj Faith ""teaches us that human dignity is affirmed through participating in our democracy...Vanita Gupta upholds these same core principles of fairness, justice &amp; equal participation in politics.""

https://t.co/yj5FUlLvg3 Our nation rose to the challenge of the Great Depression by mobilizing the Civilian Conservation Corps to build infrastructure &amp; earn a paycheck. 

Now it‚Äôs time for a modern CCC‚Äîa bold &amp; diverse Civilian Climate Corps to help vulnerable communities prepare for climate change. https://t.co/ROx88GhaJI Easter Sunday never fails to bring a welcomed message of hope and renewal. After a difficult year, that message is more clear than ever. 

From my family to yours, have a blessed holiday and look forward to brighter days ahead. https://t.co/RaWa3PLO3r Three bipartisan initiatives that @POTUS and @VP included in their blueprint to rebuild the economy:
‚úÖ Investments to make U.S. supply chains more resilient
‚úÖ 1 million or more new registered apprenticeship slots
‚úÖ Building 10 new regional economic innovation hubs Today marks 2,000 days that US citizen Siamak Namazi has been unjustly held in Iran‚Äôs notorious Evin Prison. Tehran‚Äôs human rights abuses &amp; hostage-taking must end. The US must continue to demand that Tehran release Siamak &amp; allow him &amp; his father to return home.

#FreeTheNamazis I am concerned about rising ethnic tensions and worsening incidents of violence across #Ethiopia, including recent reports that dozens of civilians were killed in the Oromia and Benishangul regions. https://t.co/IeaC9SrNrD I welcome commitments made by Prime Minister Abiy to hold perpetrators of atrocities and human rights violations accountable, and I look forward to actionable progress toward fulfilling these pledges. It is critical that @EthioHRC and @UNHumanRights have the necessary access and support required to carry out a thorough, independent, and transparent investigation into war crimes and abuses by all actors. New reports and footage emerging from #Tigray of extrajudicial killings, murders of civilians, sexual and gender-based violence, and forced displacement are deeply disturbing. I am devastated by the loss of a Capitol Police officer killed in today‚Äôs attack at the Capitol.¬† My thoughts are with the officer‚Äôs family and colleagues, and I am praying for the recovery of the second officer who was injured. I‚Äôm concerned that Alexei Navalny‚Äôs health has rapidly deteriorated in prison as Russian authorities have withheld his medical care and deprived him of sleep. The Kremlin must stop violating the most basic human rights of Russian citizens. https://t.co/77zqGqMNHc The American people know that it‚Äôs time for Congress to *finally* deliver on infrastructure. https://t.co/ZuSMYn2tVn The Civilian Climate Corps Act that I wrote with @MartinHeinrich, @SenatorLujan, @RepJoeNeguse, &amp; @RepSpanberger will provide opportunities for people across the country to help the most vulnerable communities prepare for the impacts of climate change.
https://t.co/yj5FUm36ED Now, as our country faces the COVID-19 pandemic and the threats posed by climate change, we have another opportunity to address both challenges simultaneously by creating the Civilian Climate Corps. Eighty-eight years ago, President Roosevelt tapped into the power of national service to address the unemployment crisis caused by the Great Depression and restore our environment when he created the Civilian Conservation Corps. There are so many forward-thinking proposals included in the American Jobs Plan. From kickstarting economic growth in new regions to outlining policies for bipartisan climate action, here are some of my favorite parts ‚¨áÔ∏è
https://t.co/NKnnX02IBr It‚Äôs time to finally rebuild American infrastructure &amp; invest in a clean energy future‚Äîall while creating millions of good-paying jobs. I‚Äôm going to work with @POTUS &amp; my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass the bold infrastructure plan we need.
https://t.co/PKJqan6O4v President Biden understands the need for large-scale carbon management ‚Äì that‚Äôs why his American Jobs Plan includes the bipartisan SCALE Act I introduced with @SenBillCassidy, @RepMcKinley &amp; @RepVeasey to help develop carbon capture and storage infrastructure. Let‚Äôs get it done. We need to act urgently to reduce our emissions. 

Now is the time to invest in carbon capture and storage ‚Äì a promising technology with broad, bipartisan support.
https://t.co/TCAznR5C6Q But many small businesses still need help to get through the next phase of recovery. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pleased that today @POTUS signed our bipartisan bill¬†to ensure the PPP remains active &amp; small businesses can keep their doors open &amp; employees on payroll. https://t.co/9HoTzudPTM Throughout this pandemic, small business owners in Delaware have been fighting to preserve jobs in their communities. The Paycheck Protection Program has served as a critical lifeline, providing more than 6600 loans to DE businesses since Congress renewed the program in December. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to promptly consider and hold hearings on these highly qualified nominees. The diversity of backgrounds and experiences reflected in these candidates will strengthen the federal judiciary and ensure that it reflects the country it serves. I commend President Biden for announcing 11 groundbreaking, highly qualified judicial nominees who are dedicated to the rule of law and have diverse professional backgrounds ‚Äì in courts, in public service, in the military, as public defenders, and as civil rights lawyers. ‚ÄúWe must acknowledge that our country is in the midst of a full-blown civics crisis and take decisive action to fix it.‚Äù

@RetiredOrrin and I don‚Äôt always agree, but on the importance of civics education, he‚Äôs right. We cannot wait to invest in civics ed.
https://t.co/1kh0FnqwIS Excellent piece from @AnnMaura &amp; @ryebarcott ‚Äî who represent two communities with deep commitments to service, both military and civilian ‚Äî about what we can accomplish now and for the future if we seize this moment to reimagine @AmeriCorps: 
https://t.co/Ec28mUynx3 Pleased to see this significant breakthrough and progress toward peace in #Sudan with the signing of an agreement between the transitional government and rebel group SPLM-North on the separation of religion and state. https://t.co/jwqsY9GcrI Tonight begins the annual celebration of Passover,¬†a time to draw inspiration from the message of hope,¬†resilience, &amp;¬†unwavering faith¬†overcoming¬†adversity and¬†uncertainty.

Just as Amtrak allowed @POTUS to commute to the Senate from Delaware, hundreds of thousands of people a day take a train on the Northeast Corridor‚Äîone of the world‚Äôs busiest rail networks. I wrote the @WhiteHouse asking the president to support $55B to restore &amp; upgrade the NEC‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/EVzyF6Brl3 The Financing Our Energy Future Act would:¬†
üå± reduce U.S. power plant emissions by more than six percent
‚òÄÔ∏è unleash $15 billion in annual capital spending in wind, solar, and electricity storage

It‚Äôs time to pass this bipartisan, common-sense proposal. This week, I reintroduced the Financing Our Energy Future Act with @JerryMoran, @RepThompson, and @RepRonEstes to ensure that clean energy projects can benefit from the incentives that fossil fuel projects have relied on for decades. https://t.co/cSKkd9h3S2 As we rebuild and recover from the pandemic, we can create jobs and unleash significant private investments in clean energy infrastructure by leveling the playing field for renewables in the tax code. Over the past year, violence against the AAPI community has risen dramatically, culminating in last week‚Äôs horrific shooting in Atlanta that took the lives of six Asian women. We cannot stand by while these forces of bigotry and hate continue to plague our nation. #StopAsianHate On this anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches, I‚Äôm reflecting on my friend, John Lewis, and the ongoing fight for voting rights. https://t.co/0lEgYdTQow Proud to lead the #DrivingForOpportunity Act with @SenatorWicker.
https://t.co/5mYWxyIzsI It‚Äôs time to end debt-based driver‚Äôs license suspensions‚Äîholding back more than 11 million Americans. 

The #DrivingForOpportunity Act is supported by a broad coalition ‚Äì including law enforcement and civil rights groups ‚Äì because, frankly, it‚Äôs good policy. Carbon capture is crucial for reaching mid-century climate goals while creating thousands of jobs in the process. 

Two ways Congress can help?
üëâ building out infrastructure with the #SCALEAct
üëâ reforming tax credits to incentivize more CCUS projects #NationalService inspires, uplifts, &amp; empowers. I‚Äôm committed to strengthening 
@AmeriCorps &amp; @AmeriCorpsSr so more Americans have the opportunity to give back, gain skills, &amp; build a more inclusive &amp; just society. #FriendsOfService I am honored to be inducted into the #NationalService Hall of Fame. Thank you to @Voices4Service &amp; leaders in Delaware and across the country for this recognition &amp; for continuing to champion national service! #FriendsOfService https://t.co/CAs8AkCwV2 Congress should act now to save lives and keep our communities safe. We simply cannot accept the frequency of mass shootings in our nation. #GunReformNow. Ag is at the heart of Delaware‚Äôs economy. This National #AgDay21, I‚Äôm grateful for farmers in Delaware and around the country who have helped keep food on the table during a challenging year for our farms and families. https://t.co/TlMEWQjfDo Stopping those who are prohibited from buying a gun¬†‚Äì like convicted felons ‚Äì¬†from getting one will help make our communities safer. 

Passing the NICS Denial Notification Act is one commonsense step in the effort to prevent gun violence. #GunReformNow. https://t.co/Tpmkav8Hwn The Judiciary Committee met today to consider commonsense steps to reduce gun violence‚Äîactions we can take right now, like strengthening background checks and passing my bipartisan bill to notify law enforcement if someone prohibited from getting a gun tries to buy one. My heart breaks for the families and loved ones of the victims of two horrible shootings in the last week‚Äîin Atlanta and in Boulder. We have to do everything we can to prevent further senseless tragedies. https://t.co/nu7czUPdJM The United States &amp; our allies should push for an international investigation into ongoing human rights violations against Uyghurs &amp; other minorities in Xinjiang. We cannot turn a blind eye to forced labor, unjust detention, mass surveillance, &amp; other abuses taking place there. Because of the #AmericanRescuePlan, shoppers at https://t.co/GyqBSRXsN2 will save money through more robust premium subsidies ‚Äì helping to lower costs, expand coverage, and reduce disparities in care for the American people. #ACA11 We must also build on the ACA, and we‚Äôve made key steps recently. Now through May 15th, President Biden has opened https://t.co/GyqBSRXsN2 #OpenEnrollment so that more Americans have the opportunity to sign up for health insurance. It‚Äôs been 11 years since President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act ‚Äì expanding coverage to 20 million Americans, lowering costs, and addressing the inequities in our health care system. 

It is progress worth celebrating and protecting. https://t.co/jp836HLx1L This is a big deal. The #AmericanRescuePlan is expected to cut child poverty in half by overhauling the Child Tax Credit. That means more money in the pockets of working families and a big return for our economy.
https://t.co/uqGfi54jEu It‚Äôs not too late ‚Äì many colleges, universities, and trade schools extended their application season. No matter where you apply, you‚Äôre investing in yourself and your future.

Here‚Äôs a bill to do that ‚¨á https://t.co/eX9J3rqY7v The #AmericanRescuePlan already has broad, bipartisan support from the American people. Now, it‚Äôs my job to make sure Delaware knows just how the historic plan will make their lives better and ensure they take advantage of the benefits of the package. Delaware was one of the first states to assist people paying their rent when the pandemic hit. Nearly a year later and with help from the #AmericanRescuePlan, the Delaware State Housing Authority is launching $200M in rental assistance funds, supporting thousands of Delawareans. https://t.co/ASQz53b535 Next month, the Senate will take up legislation to enable the U.S. to compete with China economically. Here are two bills to do just that
üëâ Innovation Centers Acceleration Act 
üëâ National Manufacturing Guard Act The Center for Global Africa-APRM at @DelStateUniv is deeply important to our state. Today, as the @ARPMOrg celebrates #APRMDay, it‚Äôs important that we recognize opportunities within the African Diaspora, and be grateful for their impact here in Delaware.

Today, in our country, it seems few of us are able to work together and find common ground. 

That‚Äôs why my colleagues and I introduced the Civics Secures Democracy Act, which would support and expand access to civics education in American classrooms. https://t.co/O325f0Gx9p The #AmericanRescuePlan extends unemployment benefits through Labor Day ‚Äì extending a critical lifeline to 18 million Americans impacted by the economic wreckage of this pandemic.

#HR1 #VRAA President Johnson and Congress responded to Bloody Sunday by enacting the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which finally made real the promise of Constitutional amendments enfranchising Black Americans a century earlier.

This day became known as Bloody Sunday, a horrific day of violence in the push for voting rights. https://t.co/s9vWQUs3GK With this @AmeriCorps funding, we can empower thousands of Americans who want to serve their communities while meeting a host of urgent needs. 

This investment is a down payment on our recovery that will enable us to emerge stronger than ever. #AmericanRescuePlan In the #AmericanRescuePlan, I fought for $1 billion to bolster @AmeriCorps‚Äô engagement on COVID-19 ‚Äî from tutoring students to combat learning loss to expanding capacity at food banks and handling logistics at vaccination centers. With too many students falling behind because of distance learning, I am proud that this package also includes funding to help schools reopen safely for in-person learning and to meet students‚Äô needs. To reach the other side of this pandemic, we must get vaccines into the arms of more Americans. The American Rescue Plan includes $20 billion for vaccine distribution and $50 billion for testing and contact tracing so we can contain the virus as quickly as possible. It will also deliver needed relief to businesses &amp; nonprofits struggling to stay afloat, including efforts I helped lead to provide $25 billion for restaurants in DE &amp; across the country and to support a small business lending program, which has already helped ~110 DE businesses. The #AmericanRescuePlan is what Delaware and our country need at this moment. And with unemployment set to expire in days, we have no time to waste.

As co-chair of the International Conservation Caucus and the Climate Solutions Caucus, I am committed to protecting the plants and animals that sustain life around the world and make Delaware a beautiful place to call home. https://t.co/sEZD94O2EK These sanctions closely align with the actions I called for¬†in my¬†Holding Russia Accountable for Malign Activities Act and send a clear message that the United States and its allies will not tolerate the repression and corruption of Putin‚Äôs regime. I applaud the Biden¬†administration for sanctioning those involved in the poisoning and imprisonment of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. 

We cannot turn a blind eye to the Kremlin‚Äôs use of chemical weapons against its own citizens. From our forests to our seas, from the mountains to the savannah, our actions directly shape ecosystems and the creatures that live there. We must be good stewards and work to protect wildlife, today and every day. #WorldWildlifeDay https://t.co/ZADnpqWzfG Happy #WorldWildifeDay! Today, I‚Äôm thinking of old travels and the wildlife I‚Äôve been blessed to see in my lifetime. https://t.co/qGz9KsRrst There has been a persistent &amp; broad effort‚Äîincluding at CPAC last weekend‚Äîto mischaracterize the participants of the riot of January 6. Watch FBI Director Wray set the record straight. https://t.co/IuYp5nHAa3 We must confront the ways in which online disinformation and conspiracy theories lead to radicalization and helped pave the way for the tragic January 6 attack. Far-right extremists &amp; white supremacists pose the most dangerous domestic threat to our nation. We must all acknowledge what happened on Jan. 6 to ensure it can never happen again. Today, I questioned Dir. Wray on how the FBI will respond to this threat: https://t.co/vZTrerOdYY https://t.co/xBhjhtMM1i We need to grapple with how extremists have used social media to organize and incite violence.  

I asked FBI Director Wray what role social media played in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Here‚Äôs what he said: https://t.co/xKc0TR6H0o I am eager to work with @PMAbiy and his government to address these issues, support the Ethiopian people, and rebuild our important partnership. I'm also concerned about the deteriorating health condition of detained opposition politicians participating in a hunger strike. I welcome news of their transfer to the hospital for treatment &amp; I support efforts of elders &amp; religious leaders to mediate a resolution to the crisis. Allowing foreign correspondents back into Tigray is a welcomed step. But it has been accompanied by the detention of Ethiopian journalists and media workers they rely on‚Äîlike Mekelle German Gebru, Alula Akalu, and Fitsum Berhane. Persistent fighting in Tigray threatens the delivery of aid, fuels displacement, &amp; delays Tigray‚Äôs recovery. 

I hope to see Ethiopian leaders call for a cessation of hostilities &amp; talks with the TPLF to improve the security situation &amp; cultivate peace. https://t.co/Zw5kFYMICN While the Ethiopian gov‚Äôt has taken a few initial steps to open some humanitarian access &amp; communications channels into &amp; within Tigray, much more is needed to improve the operating environment for aid workers, scale up the response &amp; get lifesaving assistance to all who need it. Disturbing accounts of systematic atrocities, looting, forced removals, &amp; sexual abuse must be investigated and perpetrators must be held accountable. The Ethiopian gov‚Äôt should acknowledge the presence of Eritrean troops &amp; irregular militia in Tigray, &amp; remove them immediately. There is tremendous promise and potential in a stable and democratic Ethiopia and a strong U.S.-Ethiopia relationship. 

Both are damaged by ongoing conflict, a festering humanitarian crisis, and reports of ethnic cleansing in Tigray. You can watch my questioning of Director Wray here: https://t.co/4hNbMyb9l2 https://t.co/lzEwWcez6d FBI Director Chris Wray is testifying before Congress for the first time after the Jan. 6 riots. I‚Äôll be asking to what extent the Capitol siege was organized through social media and what resources the FBI needs to confront this threat. We have to know the facts to move forward. https://t.co/y2O9eXvf37 .@SenToddYoung and I passed a bipartisan resolution cosponsored by more than 40 senators celebrating National FFA week and recognizing the important role @NationalFFA plays in developing the next generation of leaders. Shout out to @DelawareFFA for their terrific work! The United States is strongest when we stand up for those who are denied their basic freedoms around the world. 

@SenThomTillis and I are calling to establish a Senate Human Rights Commission to support those suffering from human rights abuses globally. https://t.co/2kGBRm60Ef üëá https://t.co/oCcokq8JuA We need to confirm President Biden‚Äôs nominees to the USPS Board of Governors. A full and functioning board is necessary to reverse Postmaster General DeJoy‚Äôs harmful changes and restore the on-time delivery that millions of Americans rely on. I object to how Postmaster General DeJoy is running USPS. 

Delawareans tell me every day about late paychecks, prescriptions, and more. I‚Äôm headed to the Senate floor now to share their stories and push for change. Watch here: https://t.co/CiweBNCZeM Merrick Garland will need a strong team around him at @TheJusticeDept.

@LisaMonaco, @VanitaGuptaCR, and @KristenClarkeJD are leaders with integrity and deep respect for the mission of the DOJ. I look forward to their swift confirmation. I just cast my vote to advance Judge Merrick Garland out of committee‚Äîa key step toward his confirmation as Attorney General. From his impressive credentials to his commitment to decency and the rule of law, I am confident he is the right leader for @TheJusticeDept. https://t.co/3niZ1IUx5M As we close #BlackHistoryMonthÔøº, I‚Äôm remembering Judge Leonard Williams. Judge Williams was a civil rights pioneer, an accomplished judge &amp; attorney, &amp; a mentor to DE students. His legacy exemplifies how we can all pioneer change in our own communities. https://t.co/9cEUGoG2NQ The Russian people deserve to know the truth, and I strongly support efforts to investigate the assassination and hold those responsible to account. Six years ago today Boris Nemtsov was gunned down just steps away from the Kremlin.¬† Despite this brazen assassination, his work to advance democracy and human rights in Russia continues. The Houthis and their supporters in the Iranian government must stop the offensive on Marib and avoid needless death and worsening the humanitarian catastrophe. All parties should agree to a nationwide ceasefire and begin inclusive political negotiations to end the war. https://t.co/zfpyb661RS What I hear most from parents is the need to reopen schools &amp; get their kids back on track. National service programs like @AmeriCorps‚Äî@BrookingsInst argues‚Äîcan offer the support that schools need to combat learning loss. That‚Äôs one of many reasons I‚Äôm pushing for the #CORPSAct. https://t.co/AuxghR527E We‚Äôve turned the page on the Muslim ban, but now must write the next chapter‚Äîone¬†in which no president can act through fear &amp; prejudice¬†to discriminate¬†against a community of faith. 

Glad to see @RepJudyChu reintro our #NOBANAct &amp; look forward to Senate intro w/ renewed support! For all those celebrating today, Happy Purim, Chag Purim Sameach! Wishing everyone a safe and joyous holiday. Glad to see the #EqualityAct pass the House. We‚Äôve made great strides for LGBTQ+ rights, but in dozens of states, folks still risk being kicked out of a restaurant or denied a mortgage just because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. 

We must demand #EqualityNow. https://t.co/TQlifMlzV5 Later this evening I‚Äôm joining Delaware‚Äôs Youth Environmental Summit alongside local notable activists to keynote and answer questions from high school students on environmental policy.

I‚Äôm proud to support the bipartisan Veterans Economic Recovery Act to provide veterans with additional education and training for quality, in-demand jobs. The Capitol insurrection made clear‚Äîwe need to prioritize efforts to combat domestic terrorism.

"Cornyn, John",JohnCornyn,TeamCornyn,Texas,Texas,Senator," Approximately 79 million Americans fully vaccinated for #COVID19 @CDCgov We‚Äôre supposed to wait on a report from some somebody that alerts the child welfare system. Is that correct?

Andrea Palm: Senator, it's my understanding that if there are concerns, post placement by HHS, that child welfare agencies may become involved. Me: So, there may or may not be a report to the child welfare agencies if these children are put into a forced labor situation, or if they're being trafficked for sex, or they're being recruited into gangs? Me: Well, after they've been placed with the sponsors, who is supposed to protect these children?

Andrea Palm: Senator, as I mentioned, it's my understanding that if there are concerns ... that the child welfare agencies may get involved. Me: So, do you share my concern for the welfare of these children once they're placed with these sponsors who may not even be American citizens, who may not even be related to the child?

Andrea Palm: Senator, our mission at HHS is the safety and welfare of those children ... . Me: Are you aware of the investigation of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations ... that revealed that some unaccompanied children, once placed with sponsors I believe in Ohio, were put into a forced labor... . 

Andrea Palm: I had heard of that, sir. Yes. Me: Are you aware of the fact that roughly 18% of the wellness checks - telephone calls made to the sponsor‚Äôs telephone number - go unanswered?

Andrea Palm: I did not know that, sir. Me: Which government agency monitors the welfare of these children once they're placed with sponsors? Is there any government agency you're aware of that has that responsibility?

Andrea Palm: It's my understanding, ... once they're placed, state child welfare agencies ... . Me: And after you've placed them with sponsors, is the responsibility of the Office of Refugee Resettlement finished?

Andrea Palm: As I understand it, Senator, yes. Me: And you mentioned that your goal would be to place these children, unaccompanied children, with sponsors as soon as you could.

Andrea Palm: Yeah, our mission is to find the sponsors ... while their immigration processes are proceeding. My conversation with Andrea Palm, for Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services, the current border crisis: 

Me: So, if confirmed, you would oversee the Office of Refugee Resettlement, correct?

I‚Äôm working with @PattyMurray to pass the EACH Act to make sure reproductive health care is accessible to all, regardless of their income or how they get health insurance.

I‚Äôm calling on @DeptVetAffairs to combat this misinfo and encourage our vets to get vaccinated. https://t.co/nGetQFSLzM Voter suppression laws are being pushed across the country. 
 
Let‚Äôs call this what it is: an attack on Americans who showed up, exercised their right to vote, and made their voices heard. 
 
We‚Äôve got to #ProtectTheVote and protect our democracy. Mitch McConnell can sit in his office and use the filibuster to block us from ever passing voting rights legislation.

If he‚Äôs going to defend Georgia‚Äôs new voter suppression law, he should have to stand on the Senate floor and be honest about it. It‚Äôs time for filibuster reform. We need to end the epidemic of gun violence in our country. The time is now to get commonsense gun legislation passed. https://t.co/fTVCmwVxyn Thrilled to announce that Nevada is getting $25 million to expand vaccine access in underserved communities.
 
The key to recovering from this pandemic is getting shots into people‚Äôs arms, and this funding will help ensure that ALL Nevadans can access these lifesaving vaccines. More help is on the way for Nevada‚Äôs small businesses! 
 
I just voted to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to May 31 to make sure businesses can keep their employees on the payroll while we restore our economy and get things back to normal. Every day, more than 100 families lose a loved one to gun violence. 

Nevada has been no stranger to this pain. I‚Äôm on the Senate floor to honor the victims and call for action. We must pass commonsense gun safety legislation. ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/zsHIVtxPIV As the first Latina elected to the US Senate, I know there are many unique challenges to overcome, and I‚Äôm proud to introduce a resolution with @SenatorMenendez calling out these inequities while celebrating Latinas' immeasurable contributions to our nation. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/wZB96g2cSB Latinas are serving in our armed forces and as essential workers on the front lines of the #COVID19 pandemic. Yet still, many barriers remain that prevent them from being appropriately represented and recognized. Women in the US are paid 82 cents for every dollar paid to men‚Äîthat‚Äôs a big gap. And the gap is even bigger for women of color.

It‚Äôs unacceptable.

I look forward to working with him to get Nevadans back to work and ensure that economy recovery includes everyone in the Silver State. NEW: $92.7 million from the American Rescue Plan is coming to Nevada to help us safely and quickly reopen our schools. This funding will support #COVID19 screening testing for teachers, staff and students, so we can continue to reopen safely for in-person instruction. Ambulance companies weren‚Äôt getting paid unless they took patients to the hospital. That's just wrong, especially during #COVID19, when low-risk patients need home treatment so hospitals don‚Äôt get overwhelmed.

I made sure our first responders could get paid no matter what. https://t.co/Tldi964id5 Tribes in Nevada have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

I‚Äôm doubling down on legislation to make sure everyone has a fair shot at getting a safe and stable place to call home.

My thoughts are with the victims, their families, and with the AAPI community reeling from an increase in violence and discrimination. This hate must end. Russia‚Äôs malign influence on our elections is beyond dangerous. We can‚Äôt allow them to undermine our faith in democracy and destabilize our nation. The Kremlin must be held accountable, and we need to pass legislation to strengthen our election security. 
https://t.co/7CDPoc8UPh States shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to block voters of color from voting. It‚Äôs a twisted effort by politicians to protect their own jobs, and it must be stopped.

I made sure to include 100% coverage of COBRA benefits as well, which will benefit tens of thousands in NV. 
 
The time is now to deliver. My focus today: getting relief to Nevada so we can get through this crisis, reopen our schools, and restore our economy.
 
That‚Äôs what Nevadans expect and it‚Äôs what every American deserves. Southern NV is facing a housing shortage made worse by #COVID19 &amp; the effects of climate change.

This madness has to stop. https://t.co/Cof5QTXqX2 President Biden must reverse course. The Biden Border Crisis makes it tougher for Border Patrol to stop drugs, gang members, traffickers, and even terrorists trying to cross the border. They‚Äôve already stopped over 125,000 pounds of narcotics and over 120 gang members this year. Last week @POTUS announced he was sending FEMA to the border. Two months after ending the Trump administration‚Äôs emergency declaration, he‚Äôs now relying on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to fix his mistakes, all while saying ‚Äúnothing has changed.‚Äù
https://t.co/8TFNGUa3TF In some areas, DHS is releasing illegal aliens without giving them court dates. Many of these migrants will never be seen again, unless they're caught committing a crime within our country‚Äîas long as the crime isn't in a so-called ""sanctuary"" jurisdiction.
https://t.co/6lg3pz02kv Last year, 1,000 individuals were released from custody into the interior of our country. This year, that number is already over 20,000. And it‚Äôs growing every day. The CBP has said that having 4,000 migrants in custody constitutes a ‚Äúcrisis.‚Äù There are more than 10,000 migrants in custody now. One facility in Texas is currently operating at over 1,500% capacity. https://t.co/l6gPlOGyoR Illegal immigrants in so-called family units have increased by 350%, and the arrival of unaccompanied aliens claiming to be minors has risen by over 100%, according to the Border Patrol. Last month, human traffickers earned $14 million a day from the Biden Border Crisis. Cartels are profiting while workers, migrants, and American communities are suffering.
https://t.co/S8s031XwSu The illegal immigrants at the border are not fleeing persecution, they are economic migrants here for jobs. We should be prioritizing the more than 10 million jobless Americans in our country, not bringing in a flood of additional workers from abroad. In 2020, border crossings dropped by 53%. Since President Biden‚Äôs election, the number of illegal aliens crossing the border has surged to over 100,000 a month‚Äîa nearly 40 percent increase.  https://t.co/wrTnb8jC9O Last night I saw firsthand the consequences of President Biden's failed policies.

She is unfit for office. https://t.co/rDUN9IUbNv Before I could finish convincing my Democratic colleagues to vote against Vanita Gupta, Senator Durbin cut off my remarks and forced her through the Judiciary Committee despite the rules‚Äîthe Senate equivalent of pulling a fire alarm to escape a test in high school. https://t.co/qiK0D3piAb President Truman desegregated the military in 1948 to ensure ‚Äúequality of treatment and opportunity for all,‚Äù regardless of race. 

My bill would refocus our military on these noble, American ideals and on its core mission: defeating our enemies. It would forbid the military from hiring ‚Äúdiversity, equity, and inclusion‚Äù con artists to teach Critical Race Theory. And it would prohibit the military from segregating the troops on the basis of race under any circumstance. https://t.co/1PtO6r6Db0 My bill would prohibit the military from promoting the racist ideas at the heart of Critical Race Theory in reading lists, training sessions, and other educational settings. https://t.co/MK8yGvolTx Racist ideologies like Critical Race Theory are harmful to the morale of our troops. They teach service members to view one another with suspicion because of their race, and even that the very Constitution they swore to ‚Äúsupport and defend‚Äù is fundamentally racist. But the military has begun promoting Critical Race Theory to the troops, recommending books by far-left activists like Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo. 

https://t.co/WRZiR5UxfF Critical Race Theory teaches that race is a person‚Äôs defining characteristic &amp; that America is an evil, oppressive place. 

That idea may be fashionable on left-wing college campuses, but it has no place in our military.

https://t.co/nKtmoOjAAI Vanita Gupta misled the Judiciary Committee during her hearing &amp; refused to answer our written questions.

She refused to say again now. https://t.co/chorinN5Xs Vanita Gupta also refused to say whether a doctor should provide medical care to a child who is born alive after a failed abortion.

I followed up. 

She still refuses to answer. This should not be a hard question for any reasonable person. https://t.co/Rwog0yzkAm She refused to say whether it should be a crime to enter our country illegally, choosing instead to hide behind President Biden. 

Vanita Gupta is not someone who can be trusted to enforce the law. https://t.co/uXUwXiIw1J She wouldn't say whether an illegal alien who assaults a U.S. citizen and is ordered deported *by a judge* should actually be deported. 

Why does she think that is a difficult question? https://t.co/0D9C66V4U4 Vanita Gupta also refused to answer whether a U.S. Citizen or an illegal alien has more of a right to a job in the United States.

It's pure hypocrisy. https://t.co/UVXu5ZIFd4 California‚Äôs Lockdown Commissar doesn‚Äôt deserve a promotion. The Senate should reject Xavier Becerra‚Äôs nomination. https://t.co/k5f1NWovkL When Democrats talk about open borders, illegal immigrants see opportunity. So do terrorists.
https://t.co/85j1MPqtVV Law enforcement officers face enough job hazards already, so attacking these men and women simply for doing their jobs is inexcusable. Our bill will help protect police by increasing penalties for the criminals who target them.
https://t.co/aM4pxJzGWh If you let them in, more will come. That‚Äôs the critical failing of the Biden administration‚Äôs current policy. The word is out that the borders are open, and this crisis will get worse unless the administration changes course. The Biden administration must reverse course. There are three simple solutions: 1. Reapply the public health declaration to all foreign nationals‚Äîincluding minors. 2. Renegotiate a migrant protection protocol with Mexico. 3. Reenter a safe third country agreement with Guatemala. https://t.co/p1OTmeVjkD But now that the migrants are here, the Biden administration is making the crisis worse by allowing them into the country freely. Not only will that encourage more to come, but it poses a threat to American communities and American workers. Asylum is meant to protect those facing systematic persecution on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or political views‚Äînot people who want better jobs. The governments of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala do not systematically persecute. https://t.co/A9EwWmBXkg President Biden‚Äôs border policies aren't just bad for Americans. They're bad for the migrants who make the dangerous, expensive journey to get here. The vast majority are not eligible for refugee status or asylum. Climate czar John Kerry, with his private jet and multiple mansions, may have a bigger carbon footprint than many small nations. Yet the Biden administration destroyed American jobs in the name of 'climate justice.‚Äô This bill will expose their hypocrisy.
https://t.co/t9fBFnkN5k Biden nominee Vanita Gupta says every person and institution in this country is racist.

That's wrong, and her wild allegations have no place at the Department of Justice. https://t.co/WlyZ1EhorU By sending FEMA to the border, President Biden is admitting that his immigration policies have caused a disaster.

But that wont stop the flow of illegal immigrants into our country‚ÄîFEMA will help them get in faster. https://t.co/mLVRmvQ2cP The Biden administration now wants to use FEMA to help ‚Äúreceive‚Äù illegal aliens. What they refuse to do is enforce our immigration law, which is why we have this Biden Border Crisis in the first place.
https://t.co/91Wh2YcL1u It‚Äôs time for President Biden to call this what it is‚Äîa national emergency on our southern border.
https://t.co/NvbvPOSfng President Biden's immigration plan is great for human traffickers, drug dealers, and illegal aliens, but not for the United States.

We must put the American people first. https://t.co/6ESYoLgj0P Rice farmers just harvested the largest American rice crop in a decade, and Arkansas rice accounts for nearly half of U.S. rice production.

Increasing U.S. rice exports to Iraq would benefit Arkansans, other American rice farmers, and Iraqis alike.
https://t.co/5PrL0nDyix Thousands of trucking jobs go unfilled each year, but current regulations prevent younger drivers from participating. Our bill tackles both problems by allowing young drivers to pursue this career as long as their employer adopts an apprenticeship program.
https://t.co/xQ3xEuFzII White House advisor: ‚Äú[Illegal immigration] surges tend to respond to hope.‚Äù

Translation: ‚ÄúPromising amnesty and open borders caused the Biden Border Crisis.‚Äù The Biden administration claims they will stop illegal immigration by sending money to corrupt officials in Central America. 

Here‚Äôs an idea: Stop illegal immigration by enforcing our immigration laws. As murders continue to skyrocket in our country, police officers need our support. Judge Garland has allowed two left-wing radicals to be selected as his chief advisors at @TheJusticeDept who support defunding, disarming, and defaming our police.

This is simply unacceptable. https://t.co/tmRZy9irw3 Our southern border is overwhelmed with illegal aliens being welcomed into our country by President Biden.

Judge Garland refused to say whether he believed entering our country illegally should be a crime. https://t.co/ZwT549aonE Drug overdoses have killed more Americans than the Vietnam war and the War on Terror combined, yet Judge Garland intends to reduce prison sentences for drug dealers, drug traffickers, and gang members. https://t.co/DiX1Rr4VfH Today, House Democrats will join Senate Democrats in voting to send checks to prisoners, including inmates like the Boston Bomber. 

Prisoners will use that money to buy contraband like cellphones, which are used to commit even more crimes behind bars. 

https://t.co/Eh6a0XB4vc This will get worse if the senate confirms an Attorney General who can‚Äôt answer if he thinks illegal immigration should be a crime.
https://t.co/NLN19oqBoU This morning I joined @hughhewitt to discuss President Biden's foreign policy, his nominees, and the so-called Covid relief bill.

Listen here:
https://t.co/lDc175FC1i There is growing evidence that the Chinese Communist Party has and continues to harvest organs from persecuted religious groups, prisoners of conscience, and inmates. 

Our bill will identify and punish CCP members involved in forced organ harvesting.
https://t.co/HUYtwCzESP President Biden revoked the last administration‚Äôs border controls, stopped construction of the wall, ripped up regional agreements, and invited illegal aliens in when he implemented a policy of Recruit and Release.  

This crisis is of his own making. In the last 12 months on record, 83,000 Americans died of drug overdoses. More than 90% of heroin, a significant amount of fentanyl, and the majority of meth and cocaine sold in the United States comes in through Mexico. 

The drug crisis starts at the border. Since 2015, over 4,000 gang members have been apprehended at the border, including over 1,500 members of MS-13. 

As illegal immigration surges, crime comes with it. The number of unaccompanied aliens claiming to be minors (most of whom claim to be 15-17 yrs old) arriving at the border each month has doubled since November, and the number detained has tripled in the past two weeks alone. Last month, nearly 100,000 aliens illegally crossed the border ‚Äì triple the number from last February, and a more than 100% increase since the summer. 

The number of illegal aliens crossing the border has increased every month since Joe Biden was elected. The Biden administration today refused to acknowledge that there is a crisis at our southern border‚Äîa crisis caused by its policies.

 But there is in fact a crisis, and denial won‚Äôt make the situation go away. This isn‚Äôt a fight over hate or bigotry, respect or compassion. It‚Äôs a battle over truth itself‚Äîthe truth of who we are as human beings and the fundamental freedom to speak that truth without fear. Americans won‚Äôt back down. https://t.co/vvNJQjfrQ7 Political correctness will only grow more oppressive if its enforcers, like Amazon, don‚Äôt face some consequences for their actions. Here are a few ideas for starters: https://t.co/5xlnJUKwzc You don‚Äôt have to agree with the common-sense, historic understanding of gender in order to acknowledge how dangerous it is for one of the biggest corporations in the history of the world to start banning books. Amazon could easily censor other views that offend Jeff Bezos. https://t.co/bKRY70PeQ8 .@RyanTAnd‚Äôs real offense‚Äîhis only offense‚Äîwas telling the truth. He said, calmly and compassionately, that boys are boys and girls are girls. And the richest man in the world banned this book from his company‚Äôs platform. Unsurprisingly, Amazon didn't respond to my office's request for information about why the book was so hateful. That's because the book doesn‚Äôt say anything hateful. https://t.co/lLEa5Zoxpe Currently, you can get Hitler‚Äôs Mein Kampf shipped to your door with free Amazon Prime delivery. Or the Unabomber Manifesto. You can even get How to Blow Up a Pipeline‚Äîthe title speaks for itself. A few weeks ago, Amazon quietly banned @ryantand‚Äôs book, When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment. Amazon claims it banned this book for violating its brand-new policy against ‚Äúhate speech.‚Äù But that‚Äôs patently false.
https://t.co/66XPQgOcKn Most Americans know that there are two sexes, male and female, and that sex is rooted in science. These beliefs are now under attack from some of the most powerful corporations in the history of the world‚Äîincluding @amazon. https://t.co/oSgqPyIgYM Law enforcement officers dedicate their lives to protecting their fellow citizens, and an attack on an officer is an attack on our democracy.

Our bill will subject those who murder police to a punishment they deserve, life in prison or the death penalty.
https://t.co/HdAs7J7uMD Vanita Gupta advocated for the decriminalization of all drugs in a 2012 op-ed.

Yet today, when Senator Cornyn asked her if she supported decriminalization for all drugs, she replied that she had advocated only for marijuana decriminalization. https://t.co/JpFxNvf9wn Vanita Gupta's outlandish claims that every single American harbors racial bias leave her unfit to serve at @TheJusticeDept.

Americans deserve a fair and impartial Department of Justice‚Äìnot one led by someone who makes wild allegations. https://t.co/nTLFTpn3ab Colin Kahl's judgement about matters of war and peace is almost always wrong.

His bad judgement and unbalanced temperament make him an exceptionally poor choice for one of the most important jobs in the federal government. 

 https://t.co/zDrfBGOV1O Criminal organizations and drug cartels that terrorize our communities ought to be treated like terrorist groups in the eyes of the U.S. government. Our bill would help stop cartel violence by ensuring these groups face dire consequences for their actions.
https://t.co/EUglhnVOew President Biden and the Democratic Party don't believe there is a crisis at our southern border because they don't believe in borders.

The American people affected by this crisis know better. https://t.co/fJdkyP4nX4"

Does he believe people have a right to not have it? #Debates2020 Again, @JoeBiden didn‚Äôt offer a single thing he would do to China for sending COVID to us and the moderator let him by with it.

Go @realDonaldTrump #Debates2020 A quick review of @JoeBiden comments &amp; tweets right after @realDonaldTrump shut down travel from China make it clear he is lying.

On one hand she says @realDonaldTrump hasn‚Äôt shut down enough things to end COVID and blames him for the economic slump. She thinks the American people are idiots. @Mike_Pence respects the American people. #VPDebate #Debates2020 Poor @KamalaHarris has been caught lying on every single question. #VPDebate #Debates2020   Joe Biden has made it clear he will abolish the Trump Tax Cuts and he will abolish Fracking. .@KamalaHarris ‚Äò very familiar laughing problem is now fully engaged. Expect her desperation to get worse as the night goes on. @Mike_Pence is absolutely destroying her. #VPDebate #Debates2020 Go @realDonaldTrump ! Obviously @realDonaldTrump has a lot of debt, he‚Äôs a very successful real estate developer. He understands leverage and its impact in a successful economy. Equally as obviously, @KamalaHarris has no clue about the topic. Or maybe she‚Äôs engaging in class warfare.... #VPDebate She begins with a whopper of a lie by repeating the @AP fact checked and discredited line that @realDonaldTrump called COVID a ‚Äúhoax.‚Äù I suspect its the beginning of a trend. #VPDebate #Debates2020 Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday just called  @Mike_Pence a good ‚Äúpolitical performer.‚Äù I guess being a smart, dignified conservative could only be a ‚Äúperformer‚Äù and not an articulate, sincere public servant. Why does @FoxNews give him any airtime? #VPDebate #Debates2020 Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday just said @Mike_Pence has to have a ‚Äúclean victory‚Äù in the #VPDebate  in order to ‚Äúchange the narrative‚Äù. Chris and his liberal pals in the media have already determined the narrative and are practicing it every day. Go VP Pence! #Debates2020 It sounds like @JoeBiden wants to turn US energy policy over to other nations when he‚Äôs not turning it over to the Squad. @realDonaldTrump has #MadeAmericaGreat with good American made energy policy and jobs. @realDonaldTrump has rallies with thousands of people, @JoeBiden has an occasional gathering with dozens because no one wants to attend his boring meetings. #Debates2020 North Dakota is definitely ‚Å¶@realDonaldTrump‚Å© Country! #KeepingAmericaGreat https://t.co/2rlEqTQhqi I agree! #Trump2020 https://t.co/TzawhQERSI The two conventions were so good for @realDonaldTrump the videos should be re-broadcast on every medium in their entirety on a loop from now until the election. https://t.co/cp5GtGWKHQ God Bless America!

"Crapo, Mike",MikeCrapo,crapoforsenate,Idaho,Idaho,Senator," I asked today‚Äôs nominees before the @SenFinance Committee to commit to working with Congress to improve coordination between states and the federal gov‚Äôt to improve health care access and quality. https://t.co/MtnqadY7RI Across the country, states continue to prioritize flexibility and the use of innovative, local solutions to expand Medicaid coverage. Unfortunately, this desire for flexibility has met federal government roadblocks. This is especially true for Idaho. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the value of innovation and provided an opportunity to test changes that foster it.  We must carefully evaluate our response to the pandemic, and implement appropriate reforms based on the lessons we‚Äôve learned. https://t.co/p7lYY4Jqsb I have committed to working on a Senate solution to bring certainty to hard-working producers and farmworkers who have sustained the nation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. via @theidahopress https://t.co/2dg03GXh5U Happy Birthday to the United States Air Force Reserve!

We should be focused on policies that will boost productivity, competitiveness and investment in the U.S., not discourage it. https://t.co/lpH2pSSOws The federal government should not dictate financial policy decisions for the states. Idaho is best positioned to determine what its citizens need as we recover from the pandemic.  https://t.co/7sw0DIIv59 Thank you, Robert, for your ongoing service to your country and community. Robert recruits qualified personnel for entry into the Army in accordance with applicable regulations, supervises recruiting and conducts recruiting support activities.

Read on to see why a competitive corporate tax rate benefits Idaho‚Äôs domestic manufacturing sector: https://t.co/ebZLEj1ic4 Stripping law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rights--through executive or legislative action--is unconstitutional.

May we continue to reflect acts of kindness that will continue to echo through our communities and nation. Never Forget.

The #TJCA helped boost wage growth for average earners and families.¬† Corporate tax increases are paid for by American workers, through reduced wages and lower retirement account values. https://t.co/x25tJfEhk1 UPDATE: The Boise VA Medical Center is now vaccinating spouses and caregivers of enrolled veterans at no cost. If you are a spouse or a caregiver of a veteran who is enrolled for VA care and would like to receive a COVID19 vaccine, call (208) 422-1499. https://t.co/3ja3iuqBKx I am saddened to learn about today‚Äôs events. My prayers go to the family of the USCP officer who tragically passed away.

Hastily changing the tax system purely for purposes of raising revenue will bring back inversions and foreign takeovers of U.S. companies, cost jobs, shrink domestic investment and slow down wage growth, ultimately crushing ordinary workers and the middle class.¬†#jobkillingtaxes Raising taxes in the middle of an economic crisis is incredibly misguided. #jobkillingtaxes https://t.co/OwgvhNcAEM Thom‚Äôs a fighter. I‚Äôll be praying for him through this battle. https://t.co/ckt9uxv8bn Congress must exercise its oversight responsibilities to prevent waste, fraud and abuse of federal programs.

https://t.co/88EpbEidoZ The last thing we should do is put states in a predicament where they could lose the funding that was authorized by Congress to help them, just because they want to manage their fiscal policy in a way that might include some reduction of tax revenue. https://t.co/KqQje3c0IO Today, I urged @USTreasury Secretary Yellen to provide states with maximum flexibility in determining the best use of coronavirus relief funds. https://t.co/KqQje3c0IO The federal government should leverage Idaho‚Äôs experience in getting employees safely back to work. Last summer, Idaho‚Äôs Return to Work bonus program safely and successfully reduced the amount of Idahoans on unemployment, strengthening the state‚Äôs workforce and economic rebound. https://t.co/N0CEuMQmN3 States are hamstrung right now. They can‚Äôt do anything until Treasury gives them guidance. These ‚Äúthorny‚Äù questions need to be answered by @USTreasury as soon as possible. https://t.co/ticx4r3ez3 This vague provision serves no useful purpose and injects uncertainty into state fiscal policy decisions. https://t.co/Gw8kKPQgFp Please see @SenatorRisch and my statements on the attacks that took place this week. https://t.co/z1TvRlYvdJ Not only is that not good public policy, but it serves to further divide, rather than advance bipartisanship. There are significant questions about the legality of this provision and how it could be implemented. It invites lawsuits and injects more uncertainty into state fiscal policy decisions. Read that again: states can be financially punished by the federal government for providing tax relief to help citizens return to earning their livelihoods. One faulty restriction allows states to provide further tax relief, but only at a punishable cost. The American ‚ÄúRescue‚Äù Plan recently signed into law contains a number of flaws. Many provisions are vague and punt hard decisions best made by states to federal government bureaucrats. The federal government should not interfere in Idaho‚Äôs ability to provide tax relief to its citizens. https://t.co/D90vVNOmgy This is not formal guidance, and raises as many questions as the provision itself. @USTreasury needs to provide detailed clarity on the stipulations for use of coronavirus recovery funds. https://t.co/UUdV8TIpFN R ‚Äì Reach

@SenatorLankford, @SenJohnThune,  @SteveDaines, and @SenToddYoung are original co-sponsors of the measure. A provision in the American ‚ÄúRescue‚Äù Plan interferes in states‚Äô--like Idaho‚Äôs--ability to provide tax relief to its citizens to reduce the burden on working families. As Ranking Member of @SenFinance, I have introduced legislation to repeal it. https://t.co/mjQtaPI1AL Idaho led the nation in tax revenue gains for 2020. The $1.9 trillion reconciliation package recently signed into law could prohibit @GovernorLittle from enacting tax relief to reduce the burden on working families. This is unacceptable. https://t.co/SQur0JKiqY Taxpayers deserve oversight, accountability, and transparency of the $1.9 trillion package that was recently signed into law. https://t.co/hZGNdoEKoJ The items at the Seattle Federal Records Center tell the story of our great state, from the Tribes who originally inhabited this land to Idaho‚Äôs eventual statehood. I am hopeful that OMB can reverse its decision and find a better solution. https://t.co/qIY9U5BbmU I am a co-sponsor of the bipartisan HOTSPOTS Act, which would create a 2-year, $200 million hotspot pilot program to allow States, Tribes, and Territories to purchase and distribute Internet-connected devices to libraries in low-income and rural areas. https://t.co/8QQNEw5xJ7 Americans have had to adjust to a new way of working, learning, and living from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. For most people, this change relies on high-speed broadband, but many rural Americans lack reliable connectivity. The estate tax may be the most unfair tax on the books.

Republicans offered amendments to improve it.  Those amendments were rejected. The rushed process around this ‚Äúrelief‚Äù bill bypassed committees, bypassed regular order, and was devoid of true deliberation or debate. When Republicans held the Senate majority, Congress passed 5 bipartisan relief bills, the largest of which had unanimous Senate support.  Issues of this magnitude benefit from a bipartisan process. Overall, state and local governments have fared much better than was initially expected near the beginning of the pandemic. My amendment would protect taxpayers by right-sizing the amount of relief funds states receive. https://t.co/UcIHUqRS8c Idahoans deserve serious, bipartisan solutions focusing on their most urgent needs:
‚úÖgetting or keeping their kids in school
‚úÖgetting workers safely back on the job

Words from @JoeBiden and the late Justice Ginsburg on packing the Supreme Court.

I agree. .@JoeBiden's HHS nominee that would oversee unaccompanied minors refuses to call the #BidenBorderCrisis what it is‚Äîa crisis‚Äîand she can‚Äôt say whether or not she believes VP @KamalaHarris should visit the border to see firsthand the situation that she‚Äôs apparently in charge of. https://t.co/mbb3AOUOCT Packing the Supreme Court is an attack on our Montana way of life. It is a blatant power grab by the Democrats to pave the way for the Left‚Äôs radical agenda. 

We cannot let this happen. We must protect our freedoms &amp; the future of our country. To learn more about the bipartisan ‚ÄúPAWS Act‚Äù I cosponsored with @SenatorFischer and @SenBooker click here:
https://t.co/PQkaosg6Ki Hear from a local Montana veteran about why this bill is important &amp; the benefits of having his service dog, Bradley by his side. https://t.co/H9yPXjIt99 Too many MT veterans suffer invisible wounds when they return home &amp; should have access to all recovery options.

Glad to cosponsor a bipartisan bill to help connect MT veterans struggling with PTSD with a service dog. Dogs play a vital role in many veterans' recovery process. Earmarks promote backroom deals that make lobbyists rich on the taxpayer's dime. They're a relic of the swampy politics that DC‚Äôs known for &amp; one of the best things Congress did was get rid of them. 

That's why I have a bill to uphold this ban &amp; fight against wasteful spending. Broadband coverage is essential for rural states like MT‚Äîit supports MT jobs &amp; makes life easier for working MT families. 

Glad to work on a bipartisan solution with @SenMarkKelly to close the digital divide by expediting #broadband deployment across MT. https://t.co/QIlIrF3MQn There are two reasons you'll probably see more @JoeBiden shirts at the southern border than at the DNC: illegal immigrants know they can easily get into our country and now they're getting tons of taxpayer $$$ in blue states like New York.

Craziness. https://t.co/OvowzpwxmL Southern border crossings are the highest we‚Äôve seen in 15 years. Facilities are over capacity, children &amp; families are in horrible situations and border agents are overwhelmed. 

And yet, @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris are nowhere to be found. #BidenBorderCrisis That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm intro‚Äôing a bill to stop taxpayer dollars from going to any state that is providing payments to illegal immigrants. 

Americans must come first. Outrageous that while millions of American workers are hurting &amp; while we‚Äôre in the midst of the #BidenBorderCrisis states are handing out free $$$ to illegal immigrants. We shouldn‚Äôt be rewarding @JoeBiden‚Äôs open border policies‚Äîwe should be fixing them.

Science should be deciding what's best for species‚Äînot activist judges. 

Glad to work with @SenLummis on a commonsense bill to put wildlife management back in the hands of the state.

I voted no on @JoeBiden's pick to lead HHS. His radical policies fall outside the mainstream views of Montanans &amp; Americans. The Keystone XL pipeline is critical to Montana jobs and communities.

I‚Äôll be joining @SenTedCruz &amp; @JohnCornyn to see firsthand the damage of @JoeBiden‚Äôs open border policies.

MT is a northern border state w/ a southern border problem. Mexican meth devastates our communities‚Äîwe need a secure border. Woke capitalism has infiltrated every aspect of our society. 

Now, even the SEC, a supposedly nonpartisan regulator, has bent a knee to the Left. 

When will it stop? 
https://t.co/WW30GGWHLY Rep. Haaland has pledged to learn from states like Montana that are able to balance these priorities. I will hold her to this commitment and look for opportunities where we can pragmatically work together on behalf of Montana. I voted against Rep. Haaland's confirmation to @Interior because I cannot support her hostile record toward made in America energy, natural resource development, and wildlife and land management. Since @JoeBiden has taken office he has moved to:

‚ùåStop construction of the border wall

‚ùåPause deportations

‚ùåEnd the ‚ÄúRemain in Mexico Policy‚Äù

Biden created this crisis on our Southern Border but he refuses to call it what it is, let alone take action to combat it. The Keystone XL is a lifeline for eastern Montana‚Äîcreating jobs &amp; bringing in millions of dollars in tax revenue.

@JoeBiden killed this project on Day One to satisfy environmental activists.

Now, hardworking Montanans like Josh are dealing with the fallout. https://t.co/CfbmxnmH3g Our founding fathers envisioned a limited federal government with strong state governments.

This nearly $2 trillion ""COVID relief"" package signed by @JoeBiden is designed to unleash a new era of Big Government, and rack up trillions of dollars of debt in the process. https://t.co/A37ibUV0Il ICYMI: Malmstrom's 341st Missile Wing commander Colonel Anita Feugate Opperman shared how the Air Force celebrated International Women's Day earlier this week.

Thankful for these brave women today and everyday! https://t.co/EfVavZ0A98 .@JoeBiden just signed off on billions to pay for non-COVID related USDA loans &amp; pay up to 20% on top back to the borrower. But only for ""socially disadvantaged"" farmers.

This isn't based on need. It's based purely on ethnicity. 

This is unfair to most MT farmers &amp; ranchers. https://t.co/Nzw0ckiZlb The era of big government is back. 

@JoeBiden just signed Pelosi and Schumer‚Äôs $1.9 trillion liberal wish list disguised as ‚ÄúCOVID relief‚Äù into law. 

This is a purely partisan package that funds the Left‚Äôs pet projects on the taxpayer‚Äôs dime. Rep. Haaland's hostile, divisive policies don't represent the mainstream views held by most Montanans. 

I'm urging my colleagues to look at Rep. Haaland's record &amp; consider the impact she would have at @Interior.

I'm urging my colleagues to vote against her nomination. https://t.co/NQOsZflVH8 This isn't about party politics. 

It's about the importance of made in America energy, natural resource development, commonsense wildlife management and our sportsmen. 

Rep. Haaland at @Interior would harm our Montana way of life as we know it. On trapping, Rep. Haaland said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we should allow it on our public lands.‚Äù 

She refused to look at the science and cosponsored legislation to federally protect grizzly bears...forever. She said, ""if I had my way, it‚Äôd be great to stop all gas and oil leasing on federal lands.‚Äù 

Well, as Secretary of @Interior she would have it her way.
https://t.co/Kt24hFoL2I In her own words, Rep. Haaland pledges ""to vote against all new fossil fuel infrastructure, and to fight instead for 100% clean energy.""
https://t.co/P83UESTSFp Rep. Haaland's policies speak for themselves. 

I urge my colleagues to think of what her nomination will mean for the West and the entire nation. https://t.co/Fr4D2oHvgp Great spending time with Missoula‚Äôs  Valley Christian School 8th graders while they were visiting DC.

Couldn‚Äôt let them leave without a very important souvenir‚Äîa pocket Constitution to always remember the freedoms we enjoy as Americans! https://t.co/HsS2gdhcUW And here‚Äôs a real kicker‚Äî$135 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. 

What in the WORLD does this have to do with COVID? It doesn‚Äôt. 

Montana taxpayers deserve better. Nearly $130 billion for schools‚Äî95% of which won‚Äôt even be spent until AFTER the pandemic and NO requirement to gets kids back in the classroom. 

$50 million for environmental grants. $350 billion to bail out blue states with pre-pandemic financial problems.

$175 million for boondoggle mostly blue state transportation projects. FACT: Democrats are using their nearly $2 trillion ‚ÄúCOVID relief‚Äù package as a trojan horse for their far-left agenda. 

Here‚Äôs where your taxpayer dollars are really going: The Attorney General of the United States should enforce the law not circumvent Congress to enact President @JoeBiden‚Äôs radical agenda. I voted against Merrick Garland for Attorney General because I have serious concerns about how he will use this position to enact @JoeBiden‚Äôs gun control agenda.
¬†
Our Second Amendment rights are constitutionally protected and I will always work to defend them. #2A .@JoeBiden should follow the law and fully sanction Russia‚Äôs pipeline, Nord Stream 2, to support the security of the US and our allies.

Why is Biden hesitating? He didn‚Äôt hesitate to cancel Keystone XL and kill American jobs on Day One in office. https://t.co/zSlOwoeRD8 Haaland's views will hurt the Montana way of life and kill Montana jobs. We must consider the impact she will have on the West and our entire country. I will be forcing debate on Rep. Haaland‚Äôs nomination to @Interior. 

Her record is clear: she opposes pipelines &amp; fossil fuels, ignores science when it comes to wildlife management &amp; wants to ban trapping on public lands. Shoveling all this money into an economy that is on the¬†rebound is deeply irresponsible &amp;¬†will cause¬†our debt to soar to new heights.¬†Montana taxpayers deserve better. I voted against wasting over one trillion dollars of taxpayer money on liberal wish list priorities for President Biden, Schumer &amp; Pelosi disguised as COVID relief. I‚Äôm proud to fight this fight with @SenatorLankford, @SenatorWicker and several other of my Republican colleagues. We won‚Äôt stop working to protect ALL life. Preventing taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions is something a majority of Americans agree with. I‚Äôm very disappointed to see Senate Democrats use COVID ‚Äúrelief‚Äù to get away with their pro-abortion agenda. Shameful. Senate Democrats voted to allow billions of taxpayer dollars to be used to fund abortions. 

They voted against applying a 44 year protection called the Hyde amendment‚Äîone that was included in all five previous bipartisan COVID packages. Disappointed to see a Keystone XL amendment blocked. 

It‚Äôs time to focus on my bill that authorizes the pipeline. I urge every Senator who supported this amendment to sign onto my bill. 

Let‚Äôs work together to get this done for American workers, jobs &amp; tax revenue for counties. Every single Senate Democrat just voted to keep schools closed and kids out of the classroom. Democrats just voted against $650 billion in targeted COVID-19 relief for those who need it most.

They voted it down to keep over one TRILLION dollars in wasteful, non-COVID related funding for Pelosi and Schumer‚Äôs liberal wish list. 

I‚Äôm not making this up folks. Democrats are throwing billions of dollars at schools without requiring them to open. 

They're also not requiring the billions of dollars to be spent this year‚Äîduring the pandemic. How does that make sense? 
https://t.co/HtuRTSQmQy While Pelosi &amp; Schumer are pushing a nearly $2,000,000,000,000 ""relief"" bill through the Senate, here's the reality:

Jobs are up &amp; our economy is rebounding. 

How can Democrats justify spending all that money when most of it has little to do w/ COVID?
https://t.co/2v2eKbhYXm .@JoeBiden, Pelosi and Schumer‚Äôs ‚ÄúCOVID-19 relief package‚Äù is nothing more than a 628 page liberal wish list. 

Let‚Äôs dig in to some of Nancy Pelosi's greatest hits. It‚Äôs not pretty. https://t.co/1azoepEIWX I voted NO on Rep. Haaland for @Interior in @EnergyGOP.

She's a far-left ideologue who is out of touch w/ MT. Her record &amp; views will hurt the MT way of life. 

I urge my colleagues, especially from Western states, to oppose her nomination when it comes to the Senate floor. https://t.co/Fr4D2oHvgp I will always defend our #2A rights. https://t.co/o4xykjkfAF Montana is open for business. https://t.co/Fedwq5qJ2D Xavier Becerra is as radical as it gets. 

I voted AGAINST his nomination in @SenFinance because I cannot support someone who is pro-abortion, attacks religious freedom, supports open borders &amp; advocates for taxpayer funded healthcare for illegal immigrants. #StopBecerra Glad to work with my colleagues across the aisle to support MT jobs, MT workers and MT energy communities. 

We must protect and grow made in America energy! https://t.co/Sx8czNGMzC In 2020, Congress passed FIVE bipartisan COVID relief packages.

Unfortunately, bipartisanship is no longer part of the Democrats' vocabulary. This nearly $2 trillion hyper-partisan ‚ÄúCOVID package‚Äù is just a laundry list of liberal priorities for @JoeBiden, Schumer &amp; Pelosi. https://t.co/YawcfcH3Kk .@JoeBiden has made promises to infringe on 2nd Amendment rights. We must act now to protect these rights for all Montanans and Americans. We must protect the #2A rights of Montanans and all Americans‚Äîincluding when crossing state lines. 
https://t.co/h9FJ6dYos9 I urge my colleagues to oppose her nomination this week in the @EnergyGOP Committee. We must stand for American energy jobs, protect workers and practice commonsense wildlife &amp; land management. Rep. Haaland is a far-left ideologue with a record to prove it. Her confirmation will hurt Montana &amp; the Western way of life as we know it. https://t.co/ru5knXjUZX Huge news! We will soon have three authorized vaccines going out to folks across Montana.

Glad to introduce a bill with my colleagues to get rid of this corrupt practice once and for all.

Full statement on why I'm opposing @JoeBiden's @Interior Secretary nominee here: https://t.co/AABXvxe8wZ I hope Democrats will abandon this bloated partisan package and instead work in a bipartisan manner to help the millions of Americans still struggling. https://t.co/mDWX6q8han We need a Secretary of @Interior that will stand up for our workers, jobs and tax revenue when it‚Äôs the right thing to do. Rep. Haaland does not share this view. 

More to follow. Rep. Haaland said she will blindly follow @JoeBiden's radical, anti-American energy agenda. She refused to answer whether or not she stands by her hostile record and divisive rhetoric on energy. Grizzly management is critical for MT‚Äîfor wildlife habitat &amp; public safety.

Rep. Haaland won't commit to following the science to delist species &amp; even cosponsored a bill to provide federal protections of the grizzly in perpetuity. To ignore science is detrimental for MT. Today, I had the opportunity to ask @JoeBiden's @Interior  nominee Rep. Haaland straightforward questions about her record and about important issues for Montana. Thankful for @GovGianforte‚Äôs leadership and work to protect Made in America energy, Montana jobs and tax revenue for Montana communities. https://t.co/cR4MqFVH4y The Paris Climate Agreement will do nothing except cause more hard-working Americans to lose their jobs and burden American families with higher energy prices.

It's a mistake for Democrats to bring them back. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm intro‚Äôing a bill to keep them banned. This is exactly why @JoeBiden‚Äôs nomination for @Interior is extremely alarming. Rep. Haaland has called for the elimination of oil, natural gas AND coal. America can not afford this radical transition away from reliable energy. Texas is frozen solid as folks are left w/ no power to stay safe &amp; warm. 

This is a perfect example of the need for reliable energy sources like natural gas &amp; coal.

By passing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, we can help restore trust and #StopAAPIHate. Many American manufacturers answered the call to boost production of N95 respirators, yet now find themselves sitting on stockpiles of this valuable PPE.

No one should die from preventable causes. Thinking of Officer Billy Evans today.

Thinking of his wife and his two young kids who never got to say goodbye.

Thinking of our Capitol Police force and all who knew him as he lies in honor in our nation's Capitol Rotunda.

Officer Evans died a hero. The fatal shooting of Daunte Wright is a horrific tragedy that should not have happened. My heart aches for the Wright family and Mr. Wright‚Äôs loved ones. There must be accountability for this deadly incident.

Passing the For The People Act can't wait. My letter to the USPS Board of Governors can be summarized in two words:
 
Fire DeJoy. https://t.co/A6ng8YODzs üö∞FACT: Illinois and Chicago have some of the highest numbers of lead pipes in America.

üö∞FACT: Drinking water contaminated with lead is incredibly dangerous.

üö∞FACT: The water of Black and Brown folks is too often overlooked and underinvested.

It's time to clean up our water. We're sick of hearing ‚ÄúKung flu‚Äù and ‚ÄúChina virus.""

We're sick of seeing our community harassed, spit on and violently assaulted.

We're sick of the diseases of racism and hate plaguing our country.

Senator @maziehirono and I introduced a resolution to condemn all of it. - Marshall Plan for Coal Country Act
- Environmental Justice for All Act
- Student loan reform
- MOMMA Act
- Equality Act
- For the People Act‚Ä¶

It's a long list. Let's get to work. Also, let's pass:

- Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act
- Voting Rights Advancement Act
- Dream and Promise Act
- An infrastructure package
- Paid family leave
- Better benefits for Members of Reserves and National Guard... Don‚Äôt fall for distractions.

We just had 7 mass shootings in 7 days.

Let‚Äôs have universal background checks. https://t.co/Q4V2jTZC1f Helping the estimated 45 million Americans who experienced food insecurity in 2020 shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue.

100 million checks in pockets‚úîÔ∏è
$21.5 billion in rental assistance‚úîÔ∏è

Americans have been waiting to hear three words for an entire year.

And because Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan, we can finally say:

Help is here. A vote against the For The People Act is a vote against the rights of Black and Brown voters. Period.

If made into law, it would expand:

üëâEarly voting
üëâAutomatic voter registration
üëâVote by mail

And finally make Election Day a federal holiday.

RT if you want it passed. After years of failing to update our aging pipes, thousands of Illinoisans and Americans are essentially drinking water through a lead straw.

It's past time we have an honest reckoning about responsibly exercising congressional war powers, which includes repealing outdated authorities like the 1991 and 2002 AUMFs. Today marks the 18th anniversary of the Iraq War‚Äîa war that changed my life and countless others. Tour after tour, our troops redefine bravery. But many weren't even alive when the AUMF that's keeping them overseas was last debated. Despite them seeing me in our nation‚Äôs uniform, wearing the American flag on my arm and going into combat, people would stop me and say, ""Well, yeah, you're an American, but where are you from, really?""

And this experience‚Äîbeing seen as the ‚Äúother‚Äù is universal across AAPIs. https://t.co/l5Z0YJzZA7 Manifesting the leadership we were starved of for four years, President Biden promised 100 million shots in arms in his first 100 days.

It is the responsibility of all Americans to help put an end to the disease of hatred that‚Äôs spreading through our country and it is long past time we take meaningful steps to prevent gun violence and ensure firearms don‚Äôt fall into the hands of dangerous people.

#StopAAPIHate Blaming the AAPI community for a public health crisis is racist and wrong. 

Continuing to treat Asian Americans‚Äîmany of whom are on frontlines of this pandemic‚Äîlike ""others"" only further divides our country and leads to violence against innocent people. It must stop. My heart is with all who lost loved ones in Atlanta. While there's still so much we don't know, we do know that our Asian American community is understandably‚Äîand justifiably‚Äîoutraged after enduring a year of heinous hate crimes and discrimination.

It's why this is one of the first bills I ever intro'd as a Senator and why I worked so hard to ensure its provisions were included in the House-passed George Floyd Justice In Policing Act. https://t.co/BVGDBbyd0F My bill would help restore the trust broken between police and the communities they serve by increasing resources for training to help prevent police-involved deaths.

In the wake of the 2020 election, Republicans across the country have unveiled more than 200 voter suppression bills. It's on all of us to work together to end voter suppression and #restorethevote. Let's start by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act now. https://t.co/jX9oyRYAbJ Every year, Bloody Sunday is a reminder of the blood spilled, the bones broken and the price paid by John Lewis and other patriots on the Edmund Pettis Bridge to ensure every American ‚Äî regardless of their race ‚Äî could vote in our democracy. https://t.co/sikBHpmBpd Help is on the way. https://t.co/GudIYK6D1R Fact: 76% of Americans, including 60% of Republicans, support the American Rescue Plan.

Fact: Not 1 Republican Senator voted for the bill.

Fact: Democrats just approved:

üëâ$1,400 direct payments
üëâExtended UI benefits
üëâRental assistance
üëâQuicker vaccine distribution One all-nighter is nothing compared to the sleepless nights Americans have spent worrying about bills, rent and their families.

@SenateDems will keep working until the American Rescue Plan is passed. Communities of color are in most need of COVID relief ‚Äî whether it's a minority-owned small business or a hard-hit community that needs greater access to vaccines.
¬†
Any vote against the American Rescue Plan is a vote against equitable care and support. We have the power to cut child poverty in half this year.

We have the power to cut child poverty in half this year.

We have the power to cut child poverty in half this year.

If the Senate passes the American Rescue Plan. Shots in arms. That's what's going to get us to the other side of this pandemic.

By passing the American Rescue Plan, $20 billion would be invested in a national COVID-19 vaccination program so our neighbors and family can finally receive the vaccine against this deadly virus. Essential workers are heroes ‚Äî and we should treat them as such.
 
The American Rescue Plan devotes $10 billion to procure PPE and other equipment for frontline workers so they can show up for work more confident that their livelihoods won't cost them their lives. 2020 was full of impossible days, too many goodbyes and constant worries. 
 
@SenateDems are working hard to pass the American Rescue Plan so we can get closer to putting this awful pandemic ‚Äî one that has taken the lives of far too many Americans ‚Äî behind us. Let's get it done. For decades, administrations of both parties have kept outdated war authorities‚Äîlike the '91 and '02 AUMFs‚Äîon the books to justify military action without Congress. 

Glad to see @POTUS is open to the idea of having an honest reckoning about war powers. https://t.co/orp2aw7V1v https://t.co/RRQNlUM7HX I still get asked ‚ÄúWhere are you from, originally?‚Äù even though my ancestors were here since before the Revolution.

If Trump truly did nothing while Vladimir Putin placed bounties on the heads of our servicemembers, they deserve to know. https://t.co/FfflfxSkBo Secretary @GinaRaimondo has the problem-solving approach we need to lead the Commerce Department. 

She is committed to boosting investments in underserved communities, and I am confident she will immediately be a strong voice for our struggling small business community. https://t.co/7b90trtQ9R America has lost another giant from the generation who led our nation's civil rights movement.

Trump‚Äôs administration failed to protect workers from this deadly pandemic while they kept our country running this past year. https://t.co/WCC1bbnYL4 https://t.co/eqfOwjTTDj Today, the House and Senate introduced universal background checks ‚Äî and the reasons are quite simple.

If you can‚Äôt pass a background check, you shouldn't be able to purchase a firearm.

And if 97% of Americans agree, Congress should act. These two might be too young to drive folks to their appointments, but they‚Äôll still make sure you get in the door!

"Durbin, Richard",SenatorDurbin,DickDurbin,Illinois,Illinois,Senator," As Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I‚Äôm committed to meeting this historic moment with real change. I urge all Chicagoans to continue to face this tragedy with peaceful resolve in order to honor Adam‚Äôs memory &amp; work constructively to bring the change we need. Far too many Black and Brown men and women have lost their lives to brutal acts of racial injustice. All the evidence shows that we are dealing with a system of justice that isn‚Äôt being applied equally‚Äîand we need to change that. Adam Toledo was a seventh grader at Gary Elementary School in Little Village. His whole life was ahead of him. My heart breaks for his family and friends, who are grieving the loss of his young life. https://t.co/LyQ35ZVtvd We don‚Äôt need yet another hearing, or more filibustering from Republicans. We need Vanita Gupta‚Äôs leadership at the Department of Justice. https://t.co/49Mes5voXo Vanita Gupta did not deceive the Committee. She answered the question w/ a well-reasoned explanation for a change of heart on an important policy matter. My Republican colleagues could learn a thing or two from this nominee‚Äôs candor &amp; willingness to rethink a position once held. https://t.co/bHmoy17vae Senate Republicans are threatening to block critical nominees with broad law enforcement support because they claim Senate Judiciary Committee Rule IV wasn‚Äôt followed. Remember when Republicans didn‚Äôt seem to mind Rule IV violations so much? https://t.co/ao5UatcKYl Vanita Gupta is exceptionally well-qualified to be Associate AG. I‚Äôm speaking live on the Senate floor, urging my colleagues to support her nomination. https://t.co/hRpIJZY2dW For years, I have worked on a bipartisan basis to address the injustices and challenges that impact the daily lives of incarcerated Americans and their families‚Äîalong with the staff responsible for protecting both inmates and communities. But a great deal of work remains. https://t.co/9YKz5HX7GW Great to discuss pandemic relief for universities &amp; students with the IL chapter of @HACUNews yesterday. I'm also proud to work alongside them to keep fighting for the #DreamAct and comprehensive immigration reform. https://t.co/mrqYsIFqiW The question now is what are we going to do about it? We can start by passing the #ForThePeople Act. And then we can pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore the Voting Rights Act &amp; combat discriminatory voter suppression laws. We can &amp; must fight back. The new Georgia voting law isn‚Äôt new it all. It emerges from a playbook that's over 120 years old, going back to Reconstruction and the Jim Crow era in the South. And like Jim Crow, it is a deliberate effort to suppress voters, particularly voters of color. https://t.co/pJ37JIPweP President Biden‚Äôs American Jobs Plan is a bold, once-in-a-generation investment in America that will put millions of people to work and lay the foundation for economic growth for decades to come. We cannot pass up on this opportunity to build our future today. For decades, infrastructure in Illinois and across the country has suffered from a systemic lack of investment. The need for bold action is clear and the time for that action is now. This week, IL became the first state in the nation to ensure that all new moms on Medicaid will have health coverage for a full year post-pregnancy. Proud of my state for leading the way in efforts to improve health care outcomes for new moms &amp; babies, especially those of color. https://t.co/ifRG80kGA3 As we prepare to depart, we must also ensure the safe return home of Illinoisan Mark Frerichs and all Americans held hostage in Afghanistan. They must be a top priority. I originally supported military action in Afghanistan to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, but we have long since lost sight of our original mission. Twenty years are enough. The longest war in U.S. history will finally end at the cost of more than 2,300 American lives and many trillions of dollars. What began as a hunt for Osama Bin Laden and his gang of terrorists became an effort to bring order to a corrupt nation deep in a tribal civil war. https://t.co/seEJSGlSGB Thoughts, prayers, and tweets are not enough. We need urgent federal action to address the terrible rising tide of hate that Asian Americans are facing during this pandemic. Let‚Äôs pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and do our part to help #StopAsianHate. https://t.co/8DAHDRRy7H Today, Kristen Clarke and Todd Kim demonstrated why they should be confirmed to DOJ.

As I said in the recent @JudiciaryDems hearing on the Equality Act, instead of discriminating against and marginalizing LGBTQ kids, we should be working toward a more inclusive America. https://t.co/CeckECv1tl The fact that overcrowding of kids at our borders occurred under both the Obama and Trump Admins is cold comfort as we see the shocking photos on the morning news. Congress cannot hide behind the filibuster. After 35 years of excuses, comprehensive immigration reform is overdue. It is not an exercise in political correctness to condemn these hate crimes and those who slyly encourage them with their choice of words‚Äîit's a moral imperative to call out injustice and do something about it. That starts with the former president's inflammatory rhetoric. While it's fair to condemn the bystanders who did not come to the aid of the Filipino woman brutally attacked in NY, we ourselves are bystanders if we are silent in the face of anti-Asian discrimination. Thoughts, prayers, and tweets are not enough. We need urgent federal action. If we are going to protect vulnerable communities from the effects of climate change, we will need a coordinated national strategy. My climate bonds bill with @RepTedDeutch can help fund these crucial resiliency efforts. https://t.co/0yN5QJTKB7 Every person deserves to be loved and accepted for who they are and live a life free from unjust discrimination.

I urge the Admin to issue a revised refugee target reflective of our nation‚Äôs values and strength. We are in the midst of the largest worldwide refugee crisis in history. We must maintain robust legal pathways for vulnerable people fleeing violence and persecution and restore the refugee admissions program. In 2018, Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to pass the most important criminal justice reform law in a generation. I was proud to champion this effort with Senator Grassley. Now we're working to ensure that the First Step Act &amp; its goals are successfully implemented. https://t.co/jYJBZWaLQK Thousands of immigrant doctors are stuck in the green card backlog while they put their own health at risk serving our communities. This bipartisan bill strengthens our health care workforce and our response to the ongoing pandemic. https://t.co/wdiSQg8nw9 I commend VA for being the first southern state to abolish the death penalty, a grave injustice which is disproportionately imposed on Black, Brown, and low-income Americans. Now let's pass my Federal Death Penalty Prohibition Act to end it nationwide.
https://t.co/E0s6yEeUaP Mandatory minimum penalties have led to sentences that are unfair, fiscally irresponsible,&amp; threaten public safety. The First Step Act was a critical move in the right direction but there's more we need to do to reform our criminal justice system. Our bill is a common sense step. https://t.co/VZFx41HLTT #OTD in 1953, Jonas Salk announced his vaccine for polio, widely considered the health crisis of the time.

I stand in #solidarity with the Asian-American community to #StopAsianHate. This month I joined Senate colleagues in reintroducing a bill to expand federal background checks to all gun sales. And @senvillivalam is leading the charge in Springfield to close gaps in the background check system. These are common sense steps we can take to save lives. Gun violence is a public health crisis and we must respond with urgency. Today I joined @senvillivalam, @senatorjacqui, @SenatorHunter, @LamontJRobinson, and other community leaders in Chicago to call for action at the federal &amp; state levels to address this crisis. https://t.co/sX1aGsOsfi Rewriting the rules to make it harder to vote will disproportionately affect Black and Brown Americans.

Our friends and neighbors in the AAPI community are hurting.

Proud to join @SenDuckworth today in announcing that Illinois veterans‚Äô homes will receive $5.5M in federal funding for critical infrastructure improvements to protect against COVID-19. We cannot accept the cruelty of the Trump Administration‚Äôs immigration policies as normal.  Democrats stand ready to work on a bipartisan basis to fix our badly broken immigration system. We need our Republican colleagues to roll up their sleeves and join us. Pres. Trump‚Äôs cruel policies created a humanitarian crisis at the border. I remember when AG Sessions came before the American people and actually quoted the Bible to justify the forceable removal of children from their parents' arms. And Republicans want to return to those days? https://t.co/DgZpqHz1mh You can ready more about my bill with @JohnBoozman, @JimInhofe, @SenBooker, and @SenatorCardin here: https://t.co/izVhAm9fmM Despite the strong demand for American products and services, China and others have been busy building markets on the African continent and the U.S. is being left behind. Today I am joining a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce a bill to increase U.S. exports to Africa. This extension of the PPP will keep Illinoisans employed and allow small businesses to survive. We must do everything we can to support this economy as we recover from the devastation caused by this pandemic. https://t.co/wFHftBCghc With the American Rescue Plan, Democrats have delivered for American communities.

We both agree that now is the time is now to address the rising lake levels. I was pleased to join @ILAttyGeneral and @NatlAssnAttysGn today to discuss domestic terrorism, the 1/6 Capitol attack, and a number of pressing issues facing our communities. I appreciate the opportunity to share views and partner with State AGs. Today I am introducing two bills to restore America‚Äôs commitment to scientific and biomedical research. The American Cures Act and the American Innovation Act provide the robust funding needed to ensure America leads the world in breakthrough discoveries. https://t.co/2dcXO9Pjdz Glad to see the IRS will automatically issue tax refunds for unemployment claimants who have already filed their 2020 tax returns. This will be a huge help for unemployed Americans who are eligible for the tax exclusion included in the American Rescue Plan. For Sen. McConnell to say the filibuster has no racial history is to ignore the obvious. He was an intern on Capitol Hill in the 60s when it was used to block civil rights legislation. Just one of many such examples. https://t.co/bF7aIok7lG Our nation is built on some fundamental ideas‚Äîlike fairness.

There is no constitutional right to go off and kill innocent people. https://t.co/1mF2VUF49P Within 24 hours of my team finishing this video for today's hearing, another mass shooting took the lives of at least 10 Americans. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/9OEANNesdP Gun violence victims and their loved ones are worthy of our thoughts. They are worthy of our prayers. But they are also worthy of our actions. https://t.co/R2Hj34f0t5 In the week leading up to this hearing, two mass shootings have left the nation reeling. And it's not just mass shootings: according to the CDC, on average, 109 Americans lose their lives every day to gun violence. It's long past time to act on this nation's gun violence epidemic https://t.co/Z7OolG1QCi Now that @MartyJWalsh has been confirmed, President Biden has all of his cabinet secretaries. The Senate confirmed his 15 nominees faster than both of the previous two administrations‚Äîall while dealing with COVID-19 and passing the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/vrl7cfHVKa This is the right decision. I applaud the Biden Administration for not only standing up to the ongoing human rights abuses in China, but also for doing so in coordination with our allies.

This bipartisan bill shines a light into the judicial branch of government so more Americans can watch these significant and historic proceedings. https://t.co/dAFLorj6IP Today the House passed Dream &amp; Promise Act. It has already been filibustered in the Senate 5 times over the years, a perfect example of why it‚Äôs time to reform the filibuster. Lives depend on it and the future of America is at stake. #HomeIsHere https://t.co/0QTq26r5SP I haven‚Äôt made the Dream Act a law of the land because of one thing: the filibuster. Five times I brought this measure to the floor of the Senate and was stopped by the filibuster. I applaud the House for passing the American Dream and Promise Act. If the Senate follows suit, we would enact the most significant immigration legislation since 1986. As the original sponsor of the Dream Act, I hope we seize this moment. There is a challenge at the border but we cannot return to the disastrous Trump zero-tolerance policy that separated thousands of families. The Biden Administration is working to undo 4 years of chaos and cruelty and establish a humane, sensible, and orderly border policy. https://t.co/Kypch7dNHj Domestic terrorism perpetrated by right wing violent extremists, motivated by white supremacy, or any political extreme, must be confronted with the full force of the federal government.

https://t.co/N6kBPApUxx Gun silencers and suppressors are dangerous and don‚Äôt belong in our communities. They hide the sound of gunfire from potential victims and law enforcement. Removing them will save lives.

https://t.co/eU5p1a8ZmW Existing inequalities in health care have grown even worse. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm cosponsoring this bill ‚Äì to create an affordable, high-quality health insurance option managed by the government. It would guarantee access to care, lower costs and allow HHS to negotiate drug prices. The COVID-19 pandemic made abundantly clear what we already knew: The lack of affordable health insurance for millions of Americans is a public health crisis. Millions of Americans lost coverage. Many others delayed procedures or avoided getting care. 

https://t.co/rte2opPpHN I‚Äôm glad the Department of Health and Human Services is moving to end the Title X gag rule that has kept so many Americans from accessing reproductive health care. Title X is vital for millions to access health care and ending this rule is important. https://t.co/raGrFYVGpd I‚Äôm happy to support Vanita Gupta‚Äôs nomination to be associate attorney general. She has spent her career defending civil rights and supporting racial and gender equality. Law enforcement and advocacy groups alike overwhelming support her. I encourage my colleagues to vote yes.

This bill will boost efforts to address this pressing issue. Congress needs to pass this bill. https://t.co/siT7aDj8QB COVID-19 has exacerbated inequities in many aspects of our society, with some of the largest disparities being seen in housing. We need to continue increasing access to capital and work to end all forms of financial discrimination. #FairHousingMonth I‚Äôm very pleased to support the nomination of Ambassador Wendy Sherman as Deputy Secretary of State.

I hope we can pass it quickly, and I look forward to working with the Biden administration on this issue.

https://t.co/fkHpOxIlq7 I‚Äôm glad to see the Biden administration prioritizing the fight against veteran homelessness. The brave men and women who have served our country shouldn‚Äôt be sleeping on the streets. In California, this means redoubling our efforts to restore the West LA VA campus. https://t.co/R4lgsrGNyV Millions of Americans eligible for direct COVID-19 relief payments still haven‚Äôt claimed them.

https://t.co/vYN17Jvbvq #RamadanMubarak to all those observing in California and around the world. Wishing you a joyous and peaceful month. President Biden‚Äôs budget aligns with our country‚Äôs values. It‚Äôs refreshing to see a budget that invests in the American people, our communities and our economy. It provides a strong foundation for this administration going forward and I‚Äôm proud to support it. https://t.co/A3UzTywacq I encourage the Senate to move quickly on President Biden‚Äôs nominee to be ATF director, David Chipman. The ATF hasn‚Äôt had a Senate-confirmed director since 2015, and that‚Äôs simply unacceptable. Mr. Chipman is well-qualified to lead ATF and I‚Äôm glad President Biden picked him. I‚Äôm pleased that President Biden is prioritizing red-flag laws. Several states have already adopted these laws that allow for court orders to remove guns from dangerous people. More should follow. We need to take real action to address the gun violence epidemic in our country. This story shows how important it is to pass legislation to ban driftnets that kill turtles, dolphins and other species. Congress passed my bill to ban these nets once; we need to do it again to save the lives of countless animals. https://t.co/J3C0Ftt26w I applaud today‚Äôs announcement that the Biden administration will allocate $5 billion in grants to fight homelessness. Today‚Äôs move will help vulnerable populations with rent payments, provide wraparound support services and lead to more affordable housing. https://t.co/iN4G7WVSkJ President Biden today announced important steps to stop the spread of ‚Äúghost guns‚Äù that are impossible to trace. These guns are being used more frequently in crimes, particularly in cities like Los Angeles.

I look forward to the continued cooperation between the federal and civilian space industry and the successes to come.

Between Los Angeles Air Force Base, Vandenberg and much of the nation‚Äôs aerospace industry, California has been a leader in space for decades. https://t.co/CUsBYutfYA I applaud President Biden for bringing some common sense to the gun laws in this country.

When you're eligible for a vaccine, please get it. It's safe and the best way to get things back to normal. Last year the California legislature passed a bill providing rights to both tenants and landlords during the COVID-19 pandemic. Check here to see what protections or support you may be eligible for:

https://t.co/qsNpQ5l5Rn Good news that California may be able to reopen by mid-June if vaccine supplies are sufficient and hospitalization rates are low. But all of us need to keep taking precautions to achieve that goal. Wear masks, avoid large groups and get vaccinated as soon as you‚Äôre eligible. https://t.co/ayYvVrHJnC California is now accepting applications for rent relief from both landlords and tenants. Some counties are administering their own rent relief programs; check here if you‚Äôre eligible for the state program, a local program or both. Apply now:

https://t.co/leiUKgOMJ6 This grant will provide for more zero-emission buses, making transportation quicker in an environmentally conscious way.

This funding will help San Bernardino continue its much-needed process of improving transit options. https://t.co/49n6wRW1WK The latest COVID relief bill contains a provision expanding the child tax credit. This will benefit more than 7.8 million children in California and will help lift millions more across the country out of poverty by putting money in more Americans' pockets. Take a moment this #NationalPublicHealthWeek to thank the medical professionals working on the frontlines of this pandemic, and do your part by getting a vaccine. You can visit https://t.co/q3QRzUstET to see if you‚Äôre eligible for a vaccine and to register for one. Congress over the last year passed multiple COVID relief bills, including the American Rescue Plan. These bills can be complex, so my staff compiled resources to help families and small businesses find information on COVID relief:

This is great news! More railcars, modernized infrastructure and other improvements will allow higher ridership and spur more development. April is Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Month. This year is especially important as the pandemic has limited the ability of survivors to seek support. The National Sexual Violence Resource Center has information on how to find help here:

https://t.co/XrO5ozUEfH My thoughts are with the victims and families of last night‚Äôs shooting in Orange. Even more heartbreaking are reports that a child was killed. Enough is enough.

Getting as many people vaccinated as possible is a big part of finally defeating COVID. https://t.co/XPeBUTEvDA Yesterday I led a group of my colleagues from California on a letter to the administration explaining the need to transition seasonal federal firefighters into a full-time workforce. We must adapt to the reality that climate change is extending the fire season year-round. https://t.co/GaYyaxfbPh When will Republicans in Congress recognize that the vast majority of Americans support commonsense gun safety reform? When will they stand up to the NRA and join us in working to prevent another tragedy? https://t.co/HqpDoxMz8Q Climate change is causing wildfires to burn more frequently, extending the traditional fire season to be nearly year-round. The administration should transition to a full-time federal wildland fire workforce to meet the growing threat of fire. Read our letter here: https://t.co/WIiLnp3US7 Census Bureau data shows that nearly 20% of adult renters aren‚Äôt caught up on rent. Last week I wrote CDC Director Walensky urging an extension of this moratorium. Without this order, there could be a significant surge in homelessness. We can‚Äôt let that happen. https://t.co/TKGL3gNsNa I‚Äôm glad the CDC has extended the federal moratorium on evictions. The pandemic has caused millions of Americans to fall behind on their rent and we must help these families keep their homes. https://t.co/HTovQ6odJt We need to end the last administration‚Äôs expansion of short-term health plans that can deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions and don‚Äôt have to cover most basic services, forcing people to pay out-of-pocket when they need care. https://t.co/ZlJTxgXcCg Wishing a happy Passover to all celebrating. Chag Pesach Sameach! California has been hit hard by our nation‚Äôs homelessness crisis and it's likely to get worse because of the pandemic. We need more help from the federal government, so @SenAlexPadilla and I wrote to @HUDgov requesting additional funding to address this crisis. https://t.co/d1SSsvrUOQ We need to end oil and gas drilling off our coasts. It pollutes our waters and is a significant contributor to climate change. My bill, the West Coast Ocean Protection Act, will end offshore drilling off the West Coast and bring us closer to a cleaner, more sustainable future. https://t.co/1Gh0RG9qxJ Plastic pollution is a clear and present danger to wildlife, wildlife habitat and human health. I cosponsored this bill led by @SenJeffMerkley and @RepLowenthal to reduce plastic production and help stop the uncontrolled contamination of our environment. https://t.co/hCExhU7txu The conspiracy theory that Asian Americans are responsible for the COVID pandemic is reprehensible and dangerous. I‚Äôm proud to join @SenDuckworth and @MazieHirono on this resolution. We all have a responsibility to refute such vile racism. https://t.co/qg1dNOL0JZ A drafting error in the December coronavirus package unintentionally removed a long-standing health care rule for California. The Senate fixed it today after Senator Rick Scott tried to make that error permanent and put hospital care for half the children in California at risk. https://t.co/OX3O31eryv The latest COVID relief bill will help millions of Americans recover so we can start to rebuild as strong as ever. Read my op-ed on the American Rescue Plan here:

https://t.co/bTztY9LGLT The Senate last night passed our resolution celebrating #WomensHistoryMonth. This month is a time to remember all the trailblazing women who paved the way for us. But #EqualPayDay is a reminder that we still have much work to do to achieve full gender equality. https://t.co/VprtfLikjY The COVID-19 recovery bill that Congress passed and President Biden signed into law responds not only to the pandemic but also aims to address some of the inequities in our country that have been exacerbated by the virus. Read more about the new law here:
https://t.co/bTztY9LGLT The U.S. women‚Äôs national soccer team is the best in the world and generates millions of dollars. But despite their success on the field, they're still paid less than the men‚Äôs team. There‚Äôs no justification for it. I strongly support @USWNT‚Äôs pursuit for equal pay. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/sPp5K3p8JZ The USS Iowa has a storied history dating back to World War II, and as a museum it has taught millions of Americans the importance of our surface navy. I‚Äôm proud to again introduce a bill with Rep. Barrag√°n that designates the USS Iowa as the National Museum of the Surface Navy. https://t.co/4WJ6avhe7S Women are routinely paid less than men for the same work. #EqualPayDay falls on March 24 this year because that‚Äôs how much longer it takes for the average salary of a woman to match the average salary a man made last year. We need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. Everyone deserves health care if they get sick with COVID, no matter their immigration status. If we‚Äôre going to end this pandemic, everyone must have access to COVID vaccines and care if they contract the virus. https://t.co/hJvFCMxnjy Throughout this pandemic, farmworkers worked tirelessly to maintain food chains and keep grocery store shelves stocked. This #NationalAgDay, I‚Äôd like to thank all the farmworkers in California and across the country for their efforts. Studies show the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban worked. Over the 10 years it was law, mass shootings fell by 37% and deaths by 43%. And in the 10 years after it expired, mass shootings increased 183% and deaths by 239%.

https://t.co/QAQCwSZGKa Military-style assault weapons don‚Äôt belong on our streets. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, President Biden helped pass the first Assault Weapons Ban in 1994. I look forward to working with him again to prevent more tragedies like yesterday in Boulder. https://t.co/1n4ti93y3D It has been 11 years since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Since then, millions of previously uninsured Americans have gained coverage and millions more can‚Äôt be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions. We must keep fighting to protect this vital law. Military-style assault weapons have led to the deaths of far too many Americans. Las Vegas. Dayton. Orlando. San Bernardino. Parkland. Sandy Hook. And now, Boulder. It‚Äôs time to reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban and get these weapons of war out of our communities. https://t.co/94PNuZ7DSd California and a group of automakers have developed the strongest car emission standards in the country, which have been adopted by 14 other states. Read our letter to President Biden calling on him to use California‚Äôs standards as a baseline for stronger standards nationwide. https://t.co/nRmUaNqn9z Now that it passed the House, we need to pass it in the Senate. I‚Äôve worked on farmworker legislation for years and can tell you this is long overdue. It‚Äôs time to give farmers the help they need and protect the essential workers who work hard to put food on our tables. https://t.co/jamzpJWudf Farmers are facing a shortage of farmworkers because of our broken immigration system. I‚Äôm proud to support the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, which passed the House last night, because it would help farmers hire the workers they need and protect farmworkers from deportation. The tragic helicopter crash that killed Kobe and Gianna Bryant and seven others could have been prevented. Our bill requires helicopters to be equipped with terrain warning systems. Read my op-ed explaining why and how we can prevent future tragedies: https://t.co/QnMLsuA8de In one year, psychostimulant-related overdose deaths, including meth, spiked by 42%. Clearly we‚Äôre in the midst of a meth crisis and we must implement a national, comprehensive plan to address this threat before it claims even more American lives.

https://t.co/BAFbwD44qg We need to help the fishing industry transition to more sustainable practices. One way is through my bill, the Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act, which will phase out harmful drift gillnets and support sustainable fisheries.

https://t.co/SNcdI1v9RK Unsustainable fishing practices harm fish populations and hurt the economy. A new study shows that unsustainable methods are also directly contributing to climate change and habitat destruction. https://t.co/7v5sszfink #Dreamers are Americans. It‚Äôs time to finally recognize that fact and remove the threat of deportation that has loomed over their entire lives. #Dreamers didn‚Äôt break the law, many were brought here as babies or small children by their parents. They now go to school, work and pay taxes here in the United States. They are U.S. citizens in all but name. The United States is the only country that Dreamers have called home. The Senate should follow the House‚Äôs lead and pass the #DreamAct to eliminate the fear of deportation for these young people. https://t.co/EULP82S63b I was pleased to introduce a resolution marking March as Women‚Äôs History Month. Women have played, and continue to play, an integral role in the development of our country. The progress has been tremendous but we can‚Äôt stop until we achieve full equality.

https://t.co/9KmkefmYDc Our country was founded on the ideal that everyone is created equal. I applaud the House for extending the deadline to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. The Senate must follow suit. We can't continue to wait for gender equality. https://t.co/JjpOebqTB1 Last night the House passed a bill to fund programs that assist survivors of domestic violence. The need for these programs has only grown during the pandemic as domestic violence cases have increased with so many people staying home. This bill needs to become law ASAP. https://t.co/xtywtZrycw JUST IN: The Senate voted to confirm Xavier Becerra as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. I look forward to working with Secretary Becerra to do all we can in the fight against COVID-19 and other top priorities for California and for the nation. https://t.co/oKOkmQHrUP I‚Äôm glad the Biden administration is taking the threat that climate change poses to our financial system seriously, as shown by new climate financial risk initiatives at Treasury, the SEC and the CFTC. 

https://t.co/UcyXAy3A0H Survivors of domestic violence have waited too long for Congress to act. Now that the House has passed a strong VAWA reauthorization bill, it‚Äôs time for our Senate colleagues to join us and support this legislation. https://t.co/R056ocWBNf Last year I sent a letter to the Bureau of Land Management expressing my concerns that mining in this area poses significant problems. We need a full analysis of the environmental impact of any expansion or modification to this mining project before it receives federal approval. https://t.co/gbKkkDNuw8 Mining should NOT be allowed in the Conglomerate Mesa region of the Mojave Desert. It would damage the environment, including Joshua trees, and destroy ancestral tribal lands. The Bureau of Land Management needs to carefully review this project to prevent environmental ruin. https://t.co/rzw1nIlLex Xavier Becerra is the right candidate to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. He‚Äôs a staunch defender of the ACA and a champion of public health. I‚Äôve had the pleasure to know him for many years and I strongly urge the Senate to confirm him.

https://t.co/oBeLRhG8FF What happened yesterday is another sad example of the violence that we will continue to see in this country as long as deadly firearms are so easily obtained by anyone who wants them. https://t.co/GWQP9gcRIy Eight people were killed, six of whom were of Asian descent. That, combined with a spike in hate crimes against Asian Americans, suggests that racism may have factored into the shooter‚Äôs motives. All of us must condemn hate wherever it‚Äôs found. Yesterday‚Äôs shootings in Georgia were a sad reminder that gun violence continues to plague our country. While the shooter is claiming that race didn‚Äôt play a role in the shooting, there are still real concerns that these were hate crimes. The pandemic has made it difficult for independent musicians, technicians and producers to make ends meet without being able to play live. We just introduced bipartisan legislation to help them recover. More information here:

https://t.co/fzPc1iJGtx The public has a right to know what the government is doing and hold it accountable for its actions. Our bill would restore a longstanding legal interpretation of the Freedom of Information Act and strengthen the public‚Äôs ability to access information. 

https://t.co/jMG3uFeSql At a time when many small businesses have closed due to the pandemic and millions of other small businesses are struggling to stay afloat, it‚Äôs essential that we have strong leadership at the SBA.

We‚Äôre also seeing a trend of more women developing lung cancer, yet we lack a full understanding of why this is the case. I look forward to working with this coalition and all organizations that recognize the threat climate change poses to our financial system. The cost of doing nothing is too high.

https://t.co/hVJuO0hibv A broad coalition of financial organizations announced support for my bill, the Addressing Climate Financial Risk Act. Reducing carbon emissions is the best way to reduce that threat, but we also must start preparing our financial system for the strain created by climate change. The new economic relief package contains many sections to help individuals and businesses. Read about some of the key provisions here: https://t.co/0EEZzM6PvD It‚Äôs scientifically proven that DDT pollution is a serious threat to wildlife and human health. I‚Äôm calling on the EPA and NOAA to prioritize this problem. We need urgent and meaningful action to clean this toxic waste up immediately. https://t.co/E3erb1Xy7r This week @Scripps_Ocean, with help from NOAA, DOD, UC Santa Barbara and other partners, launched a mission to map 50,000 acres of the ocean floor near Catalina Island. The goal is to locate and assess the condition of thousands of barrels of toxic DDT waste. https://t.co/a6fqeKDxt7 I‚Äôm glad President Biden has restarted the Central American Minors program. In 2017, the Trump administration cruelly ended this program, stranding thousands of children away from their families. Restarting this program will finally reunite these young people with their parents. https://t.co/bNmXI2bLzv I look forward to working closely with the Justice Department and the FBI on ways to reduce these terrible hate crimes and bring our communities closer together. We have to fight racism whenever and wherever it appears ‚Äì it must never be allowed to stand. We must do more to confront this problem. First steps include increasing our outreach to affected communities, ensuring the data we have is accurate and complete and providing more law enforcement training to identify and report problems. Hate crimes against Asian Americans have risen considerably since the start of the COVID pandemic. This increase appears to be based on a fabricated connection between the Asian-American community and the pandemic. Such a connection has no basis in fact and is pure racism. https://t.co/o045n3flMK I‚Äôm pleased the Senate advanced her nomination today ‚Äì the first-ever Native American Cabinet member ‚Äì and I look forward to working closely with her after she is confirmed next week. https://t.co/okUB7ufrMZ That‚Äôs why I strongly support the nomination of Deb Haaland as Secretary of the Interior. She has shown herself to be a champion for the conservation of public lands and promoter of clean energy. California is defined in large part by the beauty of our public lands and our natural resources. From the majestic Mojave Desert to the depths of Lake Tahoe to our coastal waters teeming with aquatic life, how we protect these lands is vital to the future of our state. Today alongside @ChrisMurphyCT, @SenBlumenthal and @RepCicilline, I introduced the Assault Weapons Ban of 2021. I‚Äôm hopeful that with the new administration and Democratic control of the Senate, we can finally pass commonsense gun safety reforms.

https://t.co/DfO6d5s8Yy After the ban expired, the number of massacres increased by 183 percent. We‚Äôre now seeing a rise in domestic terrorism, and military-style assault weapons are increasingly becoming the guns of choice for these dangerous groups. It‚Äôs been 17 years since the original Assault Weapons Ban expired, and the plague of gun violence continues to grow in this country. To be clear, this bill saves lives. When it was in place from 1994-2004, gun massacres declined by 37 percent compared with the decade before. With President Biden‚Äôs signature on the COVID relief bill, help is on the way. Eligible Americans will start receiving direct payments soon, in addition to the other provisions that will deliver much-needed relief. Learn more about how this law will help you: https://t.co/qm4a3mzooL I look forward to working with him to combat climate change, reduce pollution along our southern border and support a more resilient, healthier and sustainable future. As the Secretary of North Carolina‚Äôs Department of Environmental Quality, he proved to be an effective regulator and a key ally in support of California‚Äôs authority to set its own emissions standards. Michael Regan is well-qualified to lead the EPA. He is a champion of efforts to improve energy efficiency, pioneered environmental justice initiatives and fought to ensure polluters are held accountable for their impact on our communities and environment. https://t.co/Cawk4mmILT Last year @SenatorCollins and I passed legislation to create the Smithsonian Women‚Äôs History Museum. There are so many stories to tell of the women who helped make our country what it is today. I can‚Äôt wait for it to be built! #WomensHistoryMonth 

https://t.co/m9EnlZiJaK The federal government and California must address this toxic waste. The Biden administration has indicated it‚Äôs interested in taking action and I‚Äôm grateful for their attention. With help from NOAA, Scripps, DOD, UC Santa Barbara and others, it‚Äôs time to act. I was shocked when I heard that a company was allowed to dump thousands of barrels of DDT waste off the coast of California decades ago. Even more concerning is these barrels of toxic waste were ignored for so long when they pose a threat to ocean wildlife and human health. https://t.co/3gf3BvrNCy I‚Äôm glad Judge Merrick Garland has finally been confirmed as attorney general. He has spent his career upholding the rule of law and I have no doubt that will continue as attorney general. He is exactly the right person to restore honor and integrity to the Department of Justice. https://t.co/Nh6WmPrn2k It‚Äôs time to pass this bill to help ensure women across the country receive these vital protections. https://t.co/8jQT3tceVu This isn‚Äôt a partisan bill, it‚Äôs a survivors‚Äô bill. It was written with the support of the people on the front lines who know what is needed in the real world. It preserves protections made in previous reauthorizations and makes meaningful improvements to the law. Reauthorizing VAWA is long overdue. The bipartisan bill introduced in the House mirrors legislation we introduced in 2019. Unfortunately, that bill was blocked in the Senate and didn‚Äôt even receive a vote in committee. It takes Asian American and Pacific Islander women 14 months on average to earn what a white man earns annually. It‚Äôs past time to close the pay gap. Under the Biden administration and a unified Congress, I hope we can enact the #PaycheckFairnessAct into law. #AAPIEqualPayDay I‚Äôve known Lt. Gen. Richardson for many years and I know her to be a smart, capable and very effective member of our armed forces. She‚Äôs the kind of leader we need in our military. The Senate needs to move on the nominations of these strong women quickly. https://t.co/h3be4Xo9nL It‚Äôs a small number, but a sign the military is slowly catching up with the nation in recognizing the importance of having women in leadership positions. I‚Äôm glad President Biden, who makes decisions on merit, is commander in chief and recognizes that need for female leadership. Congratulations to Air Force Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost and Army Lt. Gen. Laura Richardson on being nominated to four-star combatant commands. Currently, Gen. Van Ovost is the only female four-star general in our military. If confirmed, Lt. Gen. Richardson will be the second. Congratulations to the 40th Combat Aviation Brigade on receiving the @HeliAssoc Humanitarian Service Award. Your bravery and relentless efforts to airlift 242 Californians to safety during the Creek Fire last year is truly remarkable. https://t.co/0hYCaZK6Wk It also provides nearly $170 billion to help schools reopen safely. After a year of doubt and uncertainty, this legislation will help alleviate at least some of that uncertainty and help millions of Americans while also helping contain the virus. It also provides strong support for small businesses. The legislation establishes a $25 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund to provide grants to local, independent restaurants. It also adds $15 billion to the Targeted Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. The American Rescue Plan injects much-needed funding into our national vaccine program that has finally started to show results under the Biden presidency. $50 billion will be spent on testing and contact tracing and $20 billion for vaccine distribution. The confirmation hearing for Lisa Monaco to be Deputy Attorney General and Vanita Gupta to be Associate Attorney General is underway. In my more than 20 years on this committee, it‚Äôs the first time two women have been nominated for these critical positions at the same time. https://t.co/4J8NDPWkNY"

Looking forward to joining @AmericaNewsroom shortly to discuss yesterday‚Äôs meeting with President Biden on his proposed nearly $3 trillion spending package. Tune in to @FoxNews! https://t.co/PBCeG6eyIw I support addressing actual infrastructure segment by segment with bipartisan agreement. Congress has done this successfully many times in the past. However, the Biden Administration has stretched the definition of infrastructure so far, it has become unrecognizable. The package they put forth is a policy wish-list full of non-infrastructure spending with a price tag of nearly $3 trillion. Today I joined a group of lawmakers at a meeting with President Biden to discuss the spending package proposed by the White House.

Today Nebraska celebrates 154 years of statehood. The pioneers who settled in Nebraska worked hard to turn the land into fertile farmland and thriving cities. 
 
Happy Birthday, Nebraska! https://t.co/6MUGIvSGAx I am happy to announce that the Brown County Sheriff‚Äôs Office received a $50,000 federal grant from @USDA to acquire new mobile communications equipment that will help them continue to keep their community safe.

More information ‚¨áÔ∏è: https://t.co/aAVOBjosLw Happy #FFA Week to all the Nebraska FFA members and schools celebrating.
 
So grateful for all @NationalFFA does to teach our young adults how to become the next generation of leaders in their communities and feed the world.
 
#TB https://t.co/vjq1y3HKA4 New START has been a crucial part of our relationship with Russia for the past decade. But let‚Äôs be clear: This single treaty doesn‚Äôt protect us from every threat we face. The U.S. must do more to curb the nuclear ambitions of our geopolitical rivals.
https://t.co/QthODxauam COVID-19 can be even more severe for people who suffer from heart disease, which kills nearly 5,000 Nebraskans each year. Read this week‚Äôs column on how we can promote healthier lifestyles and take steps to fight it. https://t.co/CesghP1lEJ I have long advocated for bringing more transparency to the small refinery exemption process and will continue pushing the EPA to uphold the integrity of the RFS. 
https://t.co/RKBc14JOb7 Pleased that @EPA listened to our warnings and reversed course in their interpretation of the Small Refinery Exemption process. This is a critical win for Nebraska‚Äôs economy and our biofuel producers. Today, I have joined @SenRubioPress's resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution, which limits the Supreme Court to nine justices. This amendment protects the integrity of our nation's highest court and ensures that it remains an independent branch of government. https://t.co/FMoFdyb4tn Some of my Democratic colleagues have expressed support for packing our Supreme Court for political reasons.
 
Doing so would overturn 152 years of precedent, undermine our system of checks and balances, and erode Americans‚Äô faith in our judiciary. https://t.co/ovUYr6J8Mh I am proud to have been the subcommittee‚Äôs top Republican for six years. Now, as Ranking Member, I'm committed to building on our important work in the 117th Congress. https://t.co/kF8QZWYTxA As Ranking Member of the @SenateCommerce Surface Transportation Subcommittee, I am committed to improving our infrastructure and ensuring the safe, efficient, and secure movement of freight and people. Our nation's diverse surface transportation system is critical to connecting our nation and moving our goods to market. üëèüëèüëè #NEBeef #EatBeef #ItsWhatsForDinner https://t.co/6U1pqzpXUP I look forward to the opening of the new Lincoln VA Clinic this spring as they continue to provide vaccinations and care for our Nebraska veterans. A big thank you to Director Burman, our state‚Äôs VA leaders, and healthcare workers for their dedication and urgency in getting our veterans the protection they deserve. Because of this good work, the Omaha VA ranks first per capita out of 141 @DeptVetAffairs health care systems for vaccine distribution. Through clinics across the state and with the support of the @NENationalGuard, the VA has already provided more than 20,000 NE veterans with their first dose. I just got off the phone with @VANWIHCS Director Don Burman to discuss veterans care in our state and the process for veterans to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Our bill requires the @FCC to create rules to allow domestic violence survivors to separate their mobile phone line from a group plan without penalties and take other steps to protect them from their abusers.
 
Read more on the bill in my weekly column: https://t.co/3Uh3tSPsbU Senator @BrianSchatz and I have introduced the bipartisan Safe Connections Act to help survivors separate from their abusers. When you‚Äôre stuck in the same house as your abusive partner, technology can be your only lifeline to the outside world. Many of these victims share a cell phone plan with their abusers, who see a shared phone bill, where they can often see every call and text. According to the @Ne_Coalition, there has been an increase in victims seeking help during COVID. In the 12-month period ending on 9/30/20, the programs they assist across Nebraska received 40,000 calls to their hotline. This marks my 9th year on SASC. As Ranking Member of Strategic Forces, I will continue to work to keep the modernization of our nuclear forces on schedule. And I remain committed to ensuring our military has the resources it needs to carry out missions &amp; face emerging threats. My subcommittees on the Senate Armed Services Committee are:
 
- Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Strategic Forces

His service to our country should never be forgotten. #GreatestGeneration Read more about this bill in our op-ed in @USAToday, and let us know what women leaders you would like to see on our quarters starting in 2022.
https://t.co/Klcf48DnGZ In honor of the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, @SenCortezMasto and I worked to pass legislation for the @usmint to issue special quarters featuring prominent women who shaped American history.

These coins will be a celebration of America‚Äôs female trailblazers. Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day, Honey! Home is Valentine, which always makes this an extra special day for us. Sending you love. ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/mtt9mOQAJL Accordingly, I voted to acquit President Trump. It is now time to come together and move forward. It remains true that Congress simply does not have the constitutional authority to impeach a former president. And rather than take its take time to hold hearings and assess all evidence, the House had a rushed impeachment process that denied President Trump due process. Joslyn, a seventh-grader at @BrownellTalbot, started an initiative that encouraged her community members to recycle. She collected more than 12,000 permanent markers, highlighters, and dry-erase markers for recycling.
 
https://t.co/AcrZR2jWQs Mahika was nominated for getting straight to work at the beginning of this pandemic to provide over 4,000 pieces of personal protective equipment for our frontline healthcare workers. She also sold face masks to raise $1,400 for her local food bank.
https://t.co/GuXknJHLnX Congratulations to Mahika Kanchanam of Omaha and Joslyn Stamp of Plattsmouth for being named Nebraska‚Äôs 2021 Prudential Spirit of Community Award honorees. I'm proud of their outstanding work giving back and helping their communities. https://t.co/f1Ys8P8vnr I appreciate their good work and leadership to help us fight this pandemic. https://t.co/LwngIrSAJd It has now been over a year since the U.S. recorded our first COVID-19 cases.

From early on in this pandemic, @UNMC and @NebraskaMed have been on the front lines treating, researching, and providing crucial information on this virus. My committee assignments for the 117th Congress were announced last week. Read in this week‚Äôs column how my seat on each of these committees will allow me to advocate for legislation that benefits both Nebraskans and our country. https://t.co/JItAMmK7fe https://t.co/QE1SgM7bmI The pain of losing a child is absolutely unimaginable. Bruce and I send our sincere condolences to former Omaha Mayor Jim Suttle, Deb, and family on the loss of their daughter Amber. I look forward to continuing my work for Nebraska, and I thank my colleagues for appointing me to the Ethics Committee where I will promote good governance in the Senate. My 117th Congress committee assignments: 
 
‚û°Ô∏è Senate Armed Services
‚û°Ô∏è @SenateCommerce
‚û°Ô∏è Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
‚û°Ô∏è @SenateRules
‚û°Ô∏è The Select Committee on Ethics I will support his nomination and look forward to working with him to provide certainty for Nebraska agriculture. It‚Äôs important for Nebraska farmers and ranchers to have an ag secretary who understands their key issues. 

In yesterday‚Äôs hearing, Secretary Tom Vilsack committed to working with me on addressing the lack of price discovery in cattle markets &amp; updating beef labeling policies. https://t.co/MOFGaB8AH3 Today we pay respects to Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life protecting the seat of our democracy.

He will be laid to rest at Arlington Cemetery with the honor he deserves. I thank him for his service, and my prayers are with his family. https://t.co/Ywtlv391eT Read more about the balanced budget resolution here: https://t.co/dPFFgBo0Z7 Our national debt is over $27 trillion. Families across the country make difficult decisions about their budgets, &amp; it‚Äôs time for Congress to do the same.

Today, I helped introduce a¬†bill¬†proposing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget &amp; rein in excessive spending. https://t.co/wtqJtQKLV3 Congratulations to @KRVN on reaching their 70th anniversary on air this week. From your daily grain and livestock reports to news updates, you are a critical resource for Central and Western NE. Thank you for getting vital information out to Nebraskans. Read this week's column here: https://t.co/iDqpCpp8e2 I am pleased the @USAForce is moving ahead with the rebuilding of @Offutt_AFB‚Äôs runway. This project has been one of my highest priorities in the Senate, and it will ensure our airmen in the 55th Wing will have the modern runway they need. Victims of domestic violence often must share cell phone plans with their abusers, making it difficult to fully separate. I‚Äôm proud to help introduce new bipartisan legislation with @SenBrianSchatz to help survivors cut ties from their abusers.

Together we will get through this pandemic. https://t.co/Rn3GxzD1Jq Today, I urge my colleagues and the Biden admin not to punish hard-working Americans by bringing back the 2015 WOTUS rule. Since its repeal, the more flexible WOTUS rule has helped put Nebraskans back in charge of our state‚Äôs precious water resources. https://t.co/88KmQUTI83 On January 27, 1945, the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp took place. Today, we observe International Holocaust Remembrance Day to honor the survivors of the Holocaust and never forget those murdered during this dark time in history. https://t.co/xApslE3aSW Starting Monday, planes from @Offutt_AFB will begin landing at @LNKairport. This is a sign that Offutt‚Äôs runway replacement is well underway. After years of working with the @USAirForce, I am pleased to see this project that will benefit our military, NE, &amp; our nation get going. https://t.co/rGOAaxnY7S Read more from stakeholders on how the DIGIT Act will help America reach the full potential of a more connected future. https://t.co/zbVUMhOvR6 I am proud to have worked and introduced this bill with Senator @BrianSchatz, @SenCoryGardner, and @SenBooker. I will support Governor @GinaRaimondo's confirmation, and look forward to working with her on advancing IoT and other key technologies. The DIGIT Act has been a long-term project for the bipartisan Senate IoT Working Group, and since it became law as part of the FY21 defense authorization, it has received strong support from stakeholders. During today‚Äôs Commerce Secretary confirmation hearing with Governor @GinaRaimondo, we discussed my bipartisan DIGIT Act and the importance of Internet of Things technology. This includes continuing to care for our military men and women, modernizing our nuclear forces, strengthening our Air Force capabilities, and supporting Nebraska‚Äôs critical defense assets. Providing for the common defense is the first priority of the federal government. I supported General Lloyd Austin‚Äôs nomination today and I‚Äôm committed to working with him to keep America safe. https://t.co/rQcwcu4dTs Update: we all agree that moving guard from other states out of the Capitol complex was unacceptable. Glad to hear that those guardsmen have now been relocated back inside the Capitol for rest breaks. We cannot thank them enough for their service during this time. One of the highlights was watching Sgt. Jacob Anderbery from Axtell, NE, re-enlist into the Guard on the inaugural platform. We appreciate his dedication to our state and country. https://t.co/GjYbZzYGNv This evening, I enjoyed showing members of the @NENationalGuard around the U.S. Capitol and the inaugural platform. Thank you to our guardsmen and women who have been keeping our democracy safe during the peaceful transfer of power. https://t.co/wrpnxvdSwF I look forward to voting for his confirmation and working together on bipartisan transportation and infrastructure solutions. At today‚Äôs confirmation hearing for Transportation Secretary, nominee @PeteButtigieg and I discussed safety, improving flexibility for our ag haulers, and integrating new technologies into our transportation system. https://t.co/hdfZErVfhE At noon today, President-Elect @JoeBiden will take his oath and be sworn in as our next president. I look forward to working with him and Vice President-Elect @KamalaHarris in a bipartisan manner to find common ground and continue delivering results for Nebraskans. https://t.co/C6w7VBh2C8 This year, I nominated 37 promising young Nebraskans to attend our nation‚Äôs five military academies.

These nominees have proven themselves to be dedicated leaders in their communities. I know they will represent NE &amp; the United States with honor. https://t.co/PssnZ9RPZt This article is important to read.

"Gillibrand, Kirsten",SenGillibrand,gillibrandny,New York,New York,Senator," https://t.co/kSXfAALdte https://t.co/ST1QeHDpFN Even a former senior defense official agrees, military leadership hasn't done enough to address sexual assault in the military: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to defend the department position. And whoever does that will come under intense scrutiny, because the performance hasn‚Äôt been there.‚Äù For ten years, every commander has assured me, ""We‚Äôve got this, ma‚Äôam, we‚Äôve got this."" But every year, the statistics and the stories of sexual assault in the military do not improve. We need to pass the Military Justice Improvement Act. https://t.co/8SQ01HCesx My heart breaks for Daunte Wright's family. We can never erase their pain, but we can‚Äîand we must‚Äîfight for justice for Daunte, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Eric Garner, Daniel Prude, and far too many Black Americans killed by police. We must pass the Justice in Policing Act. #RamadanMubarak to everyone celebrating the beginning of Ramadan today! Wishing you and your loved ones a month of joy, reflection, and renewal. Louis DeJoy is wrong. We don't need to cut service to save the Postal Service ‚Äî we need to expand it. Postal banking will generate new revenue for the USPS, and expand essential financial services to millions of Americans without a bank. https://t.co/81rYhDWaOS Paid leave is good for families, good for businesses, and good for our economy. So let's finally pass the #FAMILYAct and get families the support they need. https://t.co/ErtwzRtume Yeah, this feels familiar. 

Families ‚Äî especially moms ‚Äî need child care to get back to work. Without it, our entire economy will suffer. It's essential infrastructure, and we need to invest in it! https://t.co/pMDeeBl77E @believe_women_ ""Fearless"" may not be infrastructure but @taylorswift13's version is definitely essential üòÇ Americans agree:
Paid leave is infrastructure.
Child care is infrastructure.
Caregiving is infrastructure.

And they want us to invest in all three. So let's get it done. https://t.co/UFUtGaANhy Paid leave is good for families, good for businesses, and good for our economy. It's time to join every other developed nation in the world and finally pass permanent, universal paid leave. #FAMILYAct https://t.co/vabZpRfckd If your business can't run without broadband, that's infrastructure.

If your goods can't be shipped without roads and bridges, that's infrastructure.

If your employees can't work because there's no one else to care for their kids or sick loved ones, that's infrastructure. As #YomHaShoah begins tonight, we remember and honor the lives of the 6 million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust.

If we want to rebuild our economy, we need to rebuild our caregiving infrastructure. https://t.co/1wRZ0zN38H Families deserve accountability for the harm toxic PFAS chemicals have done to their health and their children's futures. That's why my bill will improve access to medical monitoring to catch health problems as quickly as possible and hold polluters responsible for funding it. https://t.co/oaAbWPzleK It was an honor to join you all today! Proud to be by your side in the fight for LGBTQI rights! https://t.co/6ks8sXuJXB Child care and paid leave ARE necessary infrastructure that women need to get back to work and keep their jobs. And if we want women to recover from this pandemic and economic crisis, it must be a part of our infrastructure plans. Women are overwhelmingly responsible for child care and caregiving. And with kids home and family sick, millions of women lost their jobs during the pandemic ‚Äî particularly Black and Brown women. Our recovery is leaving them behind.

But we can fix that. https://t.co/TtBFQrqxOg Pulling up to infrastructure week with a '67 Ford Mustang and a national paid leave plan üöóüí® https://t.co/BS0IyfOX5D Jonnie fixed the '67 Ford Mustang!

Today, President Biden signed the #AmericanRescuePlan into law. Now we have the resources we need to end this pandemic, re-open safely, and help families recover.

Help is here. To all the organizers and volunteers who helped us win the White House and the Senate in November and made the #AmericanRescuePlan possible ‚Äî thank you. Because of your work, we are getting real relief directly to families all across the country. .@TammyforIL is a trailblazer and fearless leader for Illinois families.

https://t.co/RmbeYCBD7j The GOP has passed yet another total abortion ban in hopes that Trump's Supreme Court justices will help them overturn Roe v. Wade. This is an all-out assault on our civil rights, and we must go on the offense to protect our reproductive rights. https://t.co/1ecAtFhzhg I won't stop fighting until every worker in America has guaranteed paid leave. https://t.co/L4aK8oeIHR 108 years ago, Inez Milholland led the Woman Suffrage Procession through Washington D.C. on horseback.

But for many, the average is even lower. Bangladeshi American women make $0.60. Burmese American women make just $0.52. We must fight for equal pay for all AAPI women. #AAPIEqualPay https://t.co/Zi5AhVb6Vo The Child Tax Credit has historically excluded low-income families who need it the most. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, millions more families can get $3,000 to $3,600 per child. And this simple change will cut child poverty in the U.S. in half. https://t.co/I71TfR34Xu Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we can reopen our schools in a way that keeps our kids, teachers, and support staff safe. We're investing $170 billion to help public K-12 schools and colleges rebuild and repair aging ventilation systems, implement CDC guidelines, and buy PPE. We need urgent action to help women recover from this pandemic. The #AmericanRescuePlan we passed last weekend is a step towards that recovery. Now, we must keep fighting for national paid leave, affordable child care, and equal pay. #InternationalWomensDay Today is #InternationalWomensDay, and this year we reflect on the women who have faced so many setbacks during the pandemic. Businesses have shut down, kids are home, family is sick. Nearly 5.4 million women lost their jobs and income to support themselves and their families. Heads up: The IRS will use the most recent tax return they have to determine if you're eligible for this round of stimulus checks.

So if you lost your job, lost income, or had a kid in 2020, file your taxes as soon as you can to make sure you get your stimulus checks! https://t.co/TrGkZqvKTq This is the first year we are marking the anniversary of #BloodySunday without my friend John Lewis.

"Graham, Lindsey",LindseyGrahamSC,,South Carolina,South Carolina,Senator," Speaking with @marthamaccallum on Fox News in just a few minutes about the liberals push to pack the Supreme Court and the Biden decision to withdraw from Afghanistan.  

Tune in! It‚Äôs why I and so many others strongly oppose this most radical, destabilizing idea for the Rule of Law in America. If successful, this would inevitably lead to changing the number of Supreme Court Justices every time there is a shift in power.  

Over time that would surely make the Supreme Court a political football, destroying its effectiveness and independence. Those pushing this idea are among the most liberal in the entire Congress. 
 
They are trying to dilute the conservative majority of the Court by implementing the radical policy of Court-packing. I cannot say it better than two members of the liberal bloc on the Court, Justice Ginsberg and Justice Breyer: changing the number of justices on the Court does tremendous damage to the Court itself. Expanding the Supreme Court is a terrible idea.  

I strongly oppose this proposal and will vote against it should it come up for a vote.

A full withdrawal from #Afghanistan is so irresponsible, it makes the Biden Administration policies at the border look sound. https://t.co/TjtGV7dCTY Foreign tyrants, terrorists, and thugs can use these platforms but a former President of the United States cannot.

Georgia voting laws are not Jim Crow, they‚Äôre common-sense reforms to ensure robust and legal voting. @MLB This is an insult to the people of Georgia who are trying to create a robust voting system and maintain integrity at the ballot box.

https://t.co/rTKInlyqIQ The ability to own a gun responsibly is a constitutional right in America, and here's what I would say: 

We need that right today, as much as any other time in American history! @PalmettoArmory It's not impossible to find yourself in the modern world without any police protection, because that's just the way the times are in which we live in. 

We're talking about defunding the police! @PalmettoArmory Now, why would anybody need to own an AR-15? 

If there is a breakdown of law and order, and that can happen -- we've seen it happen in our major cities. 

Remember Hugo, where people were isolated for days? Remember Katrina? In 1994, there was an Assault Weapons Ban ‚Äì the evidence indicates that there was really no change at all in crime, because the crooks are going to get a gun!  

Today at @PalmettoArmory I fired one of the weapons they are trying to ban.  #2A https://t.co/XI985BZ96F Go see for yourself. The Border Patrol and Customs agents dealing with this chaos will tell you the truth - it will be up to you to listen and accept the truth. Stop the madness. They‚Äôre being overwhelmed - thousands of young people are being placed at risk, and the Biden Administration is incentivizing illegal immigration at unprecedented levels. To AOC and other Members of Congress who deny the incredible surge of illegal immigrants at our Southern border: it is incumbent upon you to visit and speak with the Border Patrol agents dealing with the chaos.

https://t.co/1v1RRRVs4B @Facebook @LaraLeaTrump Time to Repeal Section 230.  

Stay in the fight, Lara! Big Tech‚Äôs war on conservatism and all things Trump needs to stop.  
 
Now, @Facebook has decided @LaraLeaTrump cannot interview her father-in-law.  
 
Who makes these decisions?  The liberals running Big Tech. 
 
https://t.co/hpHSCtvI6z Congratulations to @GamecockWBB for making the Final Four.  

Best of luck in bringing another @ncaawbb Championship home! https://t.co/mgW0Y1DxOj If you really believe banning AR-15s is the answer to the problem, Senator Schumer should bring the assault weapons ban to the floor of the Senate for a vote.¬† 

I‚Äôm not afraid to vote.¬†

#2A https://t.co/4adzq7hMDg If you have a family member here illegally, the U.S. taxpayer is going to pay to reunite the family illegally.  That incentivizes more illegal immigration.

If the Biden Administration doesn‚Äôt change policy, nothing will change ‚Äì it‚Äôs only going to get worse. https://t.co/MKXC5dxwO3 Speaking with @seanhannity tonight at 9:15 about the Biden Administration‚Äôs disastrous immigration policies and the push for gun control.

Tune in! #HR1 is the biggest power grab in the history of the country. https://t.co/9dXFo1WYEE Look forward to joining @FoxNewsSunday this morning to discuss immigration, our trip to the border, abolishing the filibuster and more.

https://t.co/daMBFLBOpS It makes no sense for the Biden Administration to stop construction of the border wall. https://t.co/E4uVD2uuy4 ICYMI:

What is happening at our southern border is a problem of the Biden Administration's own making.

https://t.co/jLVJIuocTX Press conference from the US-Mexico border.

WATCH:

https://t.co/IQ6sBApD4K via @YouTube Last night at the US-Mexico border: 

Migrants are not trying to avoid detection ‚Äì they are trying to get caught.¬† 

There is a loophole in our law which incentives bringing 6 year old children with you to the border. 

It‚Äôs a humanitarian tragedy‚Ä¶..and literally insane policy. https://t.co/72HjwtnY2i If the filibuster is a holdover from the Jim Crow era why did 27 Democrats sign a 2017 letter encouraging the GOP to not abolish the filibuster when we were in charge?  

President Biden &amp; his Democratic colleagues are taking hypocrisy to a new level.  
 
https://t.co/PL64wgJvGu President Biden‚Äôs news conference today makes our immigration problems worse.¬† 

He doesn‚Äôt have the situational awareness to fix the problem because he doesn‚Äôt understand the problem.¬† 

What he did today was entice people to come, not deter them from coming. https://t.co/1trhXZTAIY What‚Äôs sad is that President Biden doesn‚Äôt understand the basics about the current dynamic at the border and the ‚Äúpull‚Äù factors of illegal immigration. The Trump policies created dramatic decreases in illegal immigration.  

The changes made by President Biden have created a virtual human tsunami. With all due respect, this press conference is hard to watch.  The misinformation being given by President Biden on immigration is stunning.  

It‚Äôs clear he does not have the situational awareness he needs to understand what is going on at the border or how to fix it. The Biden Administration needs to make border conditions transparent. Headed to the border today ‚Äì will be disappointed if U.S. government agencies don't allow media to look at conditions regarding housing for migrant children.  

This wasn't tolerated by the media during Trump Administration &amp; shouldn't be tolerated now.

S-325 Speaking with @seanhannity tonight at 9:15 pm on Fox News about the situation on our southern border.

Tune in! @AOC President Biden‚Äôs words are meaningless when he says ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Come‚Äô because he is doing nothing to implement policy changes to make it more than rhetoric. 
 
It‚Äôs very sad and very dangerous. @AOC Their voices are clearly winning the current debate. The Democrats internal war on immigration is playing out in real time. 
 
There is a strong faction within the Democrat Party, led by @AOC, who want illegal immigrants to come, never be deported, and receive federal benefits such as health care.  

https://t.co/loLAEzKYID Both #Russia and #China are going to learn about American civics.¬† 

The American people are united around holding them accountable for their misdeeds.

https://t.co/rO8QwffgWT https://t.co/BHICCBqcOs While there is division in America, which is real, there is unanimity around the concept that the Chinese communist party is one of the world‚Äôs bad actors. 

#China 

https://t.co/cwcTLQXDeO https://t.co/BImyIqf4eA The situation is bad and only going to get worse.  

Unless there is immediate and drastic change, the worst is yet to come ‚Äì by far. The solutions are obvious but will require an understanding that the Biden Administration‚Äôs early policy choices ‚Äì to abandon Trump‚Äôs successful border policies ‚Äì was a mistake. 
 
It is time for DHS Secretary Mayorkas to change course or change jobs. It is clear to me the Biden Administration has lost control of the border.  

Under its current leadership it doesn‚Äôt have either the will or capability to fix the problem. 
 
https://t.co/qDEHt7aMxd REMINDER:

TeleTown Hall tonight with South Carolina residents at 5:30 pm.
Hope you can join! https://t.co/5QHkUjizmA Biden has lost control of the US-Mexico border.

https://t.co/Op4OnUD1yw If nothing else, the International Olympic Committee could at least move a few events out of China as a signal of their disapproval. Both the Biden and Trump Administrations have agreed that what is happening in China is a genocide.

I would encourage the International Olympic Committee to explore alternative sites while genocide is in process against the Chinese Uighurs. Should we make the same mistake again?  

We certainly don‚Äôt want to penalize U.S. athletes, but we also don‚Äôt want to reward the Chinese communists. The 1936 Olympics, in many ways, legitimized Hitler‚Äôs Germany to the detriment of millions of Jews and others oppressed by the Nazis.  

In 2022, it will be the Uighurs and freedom itself oppressed by the Chinese communists.  

Not exactly the venue to uphold the Olympic spirit! Much legitimate concern about the 2022 #WinterOlympics being hosted by communist China, one of the great human rights oppressors in the world.  

In my view, there are very few countries on the planet more antagonistic to the Olympic spirit than communist China. Do you have questions about the most important issues facing our state and nation?  If so, join me TOMORROW night for a Tele-Town hall. 

South Carolina residents can call-in at (877) 228-2184 and use PIN: 110055. 

I hope to hear from you! https://t.co/4pwXu6ED4n I hope conservatives throughout the nation appreciate my friend Tim Scott.  He is truly a fighter for the conservative cause.  

Stay strong, my friend. 

We have your back! He is the strongest advocate for school choice ‚Äî the best hope for struggling communities.  And the Opportunity Zones that he sponsored will improve the lives of people in disadvantaged communities. The conservative movement is so lucky to have my good friend and colleague Senator Tim Scott as one of our leaders. 

Tim is one of the strongest voices in America for conservative solutions to help disadvantaged neighborhoods and people. https://t.co/32qtxHudEv I‚Äôm calling on Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt understand that we have a crisis on our southern border then you need to resign. https://t.co/1tDq5ZpUrh ICYMI:

Spoke with @TGowdySC last night about border security, immigration, and reparations in the recently passed COVID 'Relief' legislation.

WATCH:
https://t.co/dX5CHBb8ZR Speaking with @TGowdySC tonight at 7:00 pm on Fox News 'Primetime.'

Tune in! Russia has been a bad actor in Libya, and I'm hoping that Russia and other nations who have supported mercenary groups will stand down for the benefit of the region.
¬†
Libya has been a good partner regarding terrorism, and it's now time to rebuild Libya. It is imperative that the world community support Libya, because a stable Libya is good for North Africa and the world at large. It is now time for all mercenary forces to withdraw from Libya, give the Libyan people the breathing space to move forward together. The interim unity government will need to unite a fractured nation to improve the lives of its people, provide essential services, and prepare for national elections in December. Very pleased to hear that the Libyan parliament approved the proposed transitional administration.  
https://t.co/QezacNKc8B I hope the American people understand this bill is not about COVID.¬†This legislation is about social engineering and a liberal wish list come true. I predict the legislation will not age well over time. This bill provides stimulus payments to illegal immigrants and prisoners. It also has an egregious reparations provision forgiving loans based on race and without any type of means-test. This is the first time we‚Äôve been unable to achieve a bipartisan result when it comes to COVID relief. With House passage of the COVID-19 so-called ‚Äúrelief‚Äù bill, it now moves forward to President Biden‚Äôs desk.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è90% of the money does not directly deal with COVID relief.
‚ñ∂Ô∏èOnly 1% of the money goes to vaccines. Couldn‚Äôt agree more. https://t.co/FWcYM6YlQP One of the Biden administration‚Äôs first actions upon taking office was to eliminate the Remain in Mexico policy implemented by President Trump. 

https://t.co/lSaXdJ8k22 Migrants would travel to the U.S.-Mexico border, locate a Customs and Border Protection official, turn themselves in, and request asylum.

https://t.co/lSaXdJ8k22 By their words and actions, the Biden administration is emboldening smugglers and enticing migrants to come. 

I fear that we will soon see caravan after caravan again forming in the Northern Triangle countries and headed toward the United States. 

https://t.co/lSaXdIQIDs President Trump drew some tough lines in the sand when it came to dealing with migrants seeking to game the system. 

And the fact of the matter is what he did worked!

https://t.co/lSaXdIQIDs Our Customs and Border Protection officials are heroes for the work they do in securing our border and legal ports of entry. They should be given the tools they need to do their jobs but the Biden administration is making that nearly impossible.

https://t.co/lSaXdIQIDs I was dumbfounded to find that there are holes in the wall because the Biden administration has issued an order to stop construction on the wall. I visited one site where the panels were already stacked on the ground and ready to be put up. 

https://t.co/lSaXdIQIDs It is only a matter of time until coyotes and other human traffickers spread the word throughout Central America that the Biden administration has returned us to the old, failed way of doing business. 

https://t.co/lSaXdJ8k22 Barely six weeks into the new administration, we already see an uptick in the number of adults and unaccompanied minors showing up at our southern border. 

https://t.co/lSaXdJ8k22 In 2018 and 2019, Customs and Border Protection officials were overwhelmed by asylum seekers from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, also known as the Northern Triangle countries. 

https://t.co/lSaXdIQIDs Whether it is the Biden administration‚Äôs reversal of the Remain in Mexico policy or stopping construction of the border wall, the stage is being set for a return to the lawlessness and chaos we saw at our southern border in 2018 and 2019. 

https://t.co/lSaXdIQIDs Despite recent claims by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that there is no crisis at our southern border, there is a major crisis brewing due to the misguided policies of the Biden administration.

https://t.co/lSaXdJ8k22 Reckless immigration policies ‚Äì Biden team has no one to blame but themselves

I know he will be working hard for the people of Missouri and our country until his final day in office. While I completely understand Roy‚Äôs decision, it hits hard because Senator Blunt is one of the most effective, thoughtful, and smartest members of the body.

S-325 That will make it easier for business to re-open and our economy to rebound from COVID-19.

For that ‚Äòdastardly‚Äô position he has been held hostage for more than 3 hours.  

Wondering if the Geneva Convention applies to his status in the U.S. Senate?  

#SaveJoe It‚Äôs clear liberal Democrat forces are up to no good when it comes to West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin.  

Manchin is trying to make sure someone receiving unemployment benefits DOES NOT EARN MORE than someone who gets up and goes to work. The beams are on the ground waiting to be up!  What are we waiting for?  

This is dumb, even by the standards of the federal government! 

Here is our video of gaps in the Border Wall.  

https://t.co/HxAi1aw4DO I saw this with my own eyes two weeks ago in Arizona.

It‚Äôs ridiculous the Biden Administration won‚Äôt allow them to put the beams in place and complete these gaps in the Border Wall.

https://t.co/ZMqWmw9mBW ICYMI:

Spoke about the $1.9 trillion #COVID19 legislation Democrats are preparing to jam through the Senate without GOP support.

‚û°Ô∏è 90% of the money is unrelated to COVID.  

‚û°Ô∏è Democrats are using reconciliation to fund their liberal wish list!

WATCH:
https://t.co/BDXygdI6bu Even ‚ÄòNeanderthals‚Äô would say the Biden policy makes no sense! If Texas policy of trying to return to normal ‚Äì after a vaccine has been developed and being distributed - is ‚ÄòNeanderthal‚Äô then what do you call the Biden Administration decision to release migrants into the United States who test positive for COVID-19?
 
https://t.co/RwWfmc1dZA So much for Biden being the 'unity' President.¬†

Before President Biden we had unity in COVID relief, but no more. So sad. Tomorrow, Democrats will jam a $1.9 trillion package through the Senate ‚Äî without Republican support ‚Äî claiming it to be COVID relief.¬†

However, 90% of the money is unrelated to COVID. ¬†

Democrats are using reconciliation to fund their liberal wish list. @SenatorTimScott Tim has incredible influence in the United States Senate and is an indispensable voice for the future of South Carolina. 

I look forward to Tim‚Äôs reelection and regaining our Republican majority in 2022.  

President Trump will be a major factor in this critical effort. I really appreciate President Trump coming out early and strong in support of my good friend, @SenatorTimScott reelection.

https://t.co/sndVQIYsDP Very supportive of this strike and hope it will create necessary deterrence in the future. Appreciate Biden Administration striking Iranian-backed militia groups in Syria who‚Äôve been pushing attacks against American forces in Iraq and other locations. It is imperative that our enemies know that attacking Americans comes at a cost. 

https://t.co/praCcDIpVI This decision reinforces reconciliation cannot be used as a vehicle to pass major legislative change - by either party - on a simple majority vote.  

This decision will, over time, reinforce the traditions of the Senate. Very pleased the Senate Parliamentarian has ruled that a minimum wage increase is an inappropriate policy change in reconciliation. I could not agree more with @LeaderMcConnell that Democrats are pushing a wildly liberal agenda on the American economy and their immigration policies are going to lead to another run on our border. Working together, the Republican Party will come roaring back in 2022. Very good statement by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell tonight on @FoxNews indicating that he‚Äôs bullish on the Republican Party‚Äôs future in 2022 and beyond and is looking forward not backwards. I grew up in the back of the Sanitary Caf√© in Central, South Carolina. When I was old enough I ran the poolroom. I know what it‚Äôs like for businesses to have to absorb increased costs. A $15 national minimum wage is a really bad idea. https://t.co/4JqYJDYBFl Many small businesses in South Carolina, who are being hurt by limited tourism and COVID restrictions on their business, are struggling to keep the lights on and doors open.¬†The last thing we need is Washington adding to their problems. Thank you to Carl Sobocinski of Table 301 in Greenville for testifying today before the Senate Budget Committee.¬† He made a compelling case that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour while we are still suffering from a pandemic would have a negative impact on small businesses. Jamming a $1.9 trillion COVID package through Congress is the furthest thing from unity I've ever seen. President Biden: work with Republicans and find a better way forward. https://t.co/fcTH59B6mi South Carolina restaurant owner Carl Sobocinski will share his experience with working in and owning several restaurants and how it would impact his business.

I'm urging @POTUS to take up New Hampshire‚Äôs model. https://t.co/DD6VPc2K6q ICYMI: @POTUS signed my SAVE LIVES Act into law yesterday.
 
Now ALL veterans ‚Äì and their spouses and caregivers ‚Äì will be able to get vaccinated through the VA (even if they aren't enrolled in VA services)!
 
That's more vaccines in arms and more veterans protected. COVID-19 caused industry disruptions that led to millions of Americans being left without work. Now more than ever, we need to help Granite Staters get the training they need for good-paying jobs ‚Äì that's why I support the JOBS Act: https://t.co/dtW4upyPwd For too long, @usedgov refused to forgive the loans of students who were defrauded by for-profit colleges.

That's all changing.

I‚Äôm glad that the Biden administration heeded my calls and will forgive the loans of 155 Granite Staters and people across the country. The @USPS has struggled under Postmaster General DeJoy's leadership ‚Äì to the point that I‚Äôm constantly hearing from Granite Staters who are missing their mail. While the USPS needs a long-term plan, DeJoy‚Äôs would only further diminish service. https://t.co/86yUdiE6Uh UPDATE: @POTUS just signed my bipartisan SAVE LIVES Act into law. That means the VA can now provide no-cost vaccines to ALL veterans ‚Äì even if they aren't enrolled in VA services. This is good news. It's simple: women deserve equal pay for equal work.

And it's way past time that we ended the gender wage gap ‚Äì women, families, and the nation can't afford to wait. 

So join me this #EqualPayDay2021 in calling to end pay discrimination. It‚Äôs an honor to chair the Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight Subcommittee. I was excited to hold our first hearing this morning, which took a look at our nation‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 pandemic. https://t.co/3VBF8PqVoj Veterans exposed to toxins while serving our nation have struggled to receive the care they need. I'm pushing for bipartisan action to right this wrong with @SenThomTillis. https://t.co/w7tIKjZsYF Elections should be decided by voters ‚Äì NOT corporate special interests. It's time to pass the #ForThePeople Act to ensure that money doesn‚Äôt control our politics. Taxpayers are subsidizing drug companies and are simultaneously being hit with astronomical prescription drug prices. It's just not right. https://t.co/rmOjFX9mn3 Update: State Veterans Homes will receive $1 billion from @DeptVetAffairs. After devastating losses at the State Veterans Home in New Hampshire and across the country, these additional resources are extremely necessary.

It's given comprehensive care to millions of Americans and protected people with pre-existing conditions.
 
The last COVID-19 relief package gave additional premium assistance ‚Äì and I'll keep working to build on the ACA. For too long, veterans impacted by toxic exposures have had to go through hoops to receive necessary care. @SenThomTillis and I are determined to change that ‚Äì tune in to learn how: https://t.co/g2zwS0YRM7 ‚è∞Updated Time: I'm joining @SenThomTillis at 2 PM to reintroduce the Toxic Exposure in the American Military Act. Don't forget to tune in to learn more! https://t.co/3uZWrcjsei Right now, my colleagues in the Senate are holding a hearing on gun violence prevention.

It isn't in response to last night's shooting. Or Atlanta last week.

Gun violence is just that prevalent in our country. But it doesn't have to be. We must #EndGunViolence together. $2.3 million.
 
That's how much the Dundee Forest Legacy Project in Bartlett and Jackson will receive to support wildlife, sustainable forestry, and outdoor recreation.
 
Proud to have pushed for the Great American Outdoors Act that helped make this possible. I'm introducing legislation that will lower the cost of prescription drugs for older Americans by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices on behalf of the nearly 46 million older Americans they represent. https://t.co/53S7PPev9n It's time we gave Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices ‚Äì and stopped making older Americans overpay for their prescription medications. It just makes sense. My heart is with Boulder and the loved ones of those killed, including a police officer.

Too many American towns and cities have felt the devastating loss that follows a mass shooting.

This senseless violence must end. We need gun reform now. Mayor Walsh is about to become Secretary Walsh ‚Äì proud to vote for his confirmation to head @USDOL. The latest COVID-19 relief package provides major additional support for small businesses in New Hampshire and across the country ‚Äì glad to speak with the NH Commerce Corridor about what local businesses can expect.
https://t.co/Ia0vU5gMe4 We can't turn a blind eye to the Chinese government‚Äôs human rights abuses.

While @POTUS already lifted this detrimental ban, we need to make sure it's never reinstated ‚Äì that's why I'm pushing to pass the #GlobalHERAct. Now let's #Fight4HER!

And this last package included $1,400 for children too.
 
That is food on the table, water and electricity bills paid ‚Äì that's the beginning of our recovery. This bipartisan bill would make sure that all veterans have access to the vaccine ‚Äì even if they aren't enrolled in VA health care. Glad to get this through the Senate. Now let's get this done.
https://t.co/5TSwuYj9Wo Both the SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange breaches showed why we urgently need to strengthen our cybersecurity.

https://t.co/jc0oAarEqh Thanks, @FLOTUS, for sitting down with @SenatorShaheen and me before your trip up to New Hampshire yesterday. I'm incredibly excited about what the #AmericanRescuePlan means for New Hampshire ‚Äì and I know Granite Staters were happy to hear more about it during your visit. https://t.co/ExdqwGayxZ More than 70% of all COVID-19 deaths in New Hampshire occurred in long-term care facilities.
 
Once again: 70%.
 
That's a national tragedy ‚Äì and yesterday I pushed medical experts at the Senate's Finance Committee to explain how it happened. https://t.co/n61gdEx76j Glad to meet with @FLOTUS before her trip up to New Hampshire ‚Äì I know the Granite State was glad to have her and excited to learn more about what the latest COVID-19 relief package means for our families and small businesses.
https://t.co/zC1ilFatZx Parents had to juggle their jobs and their children's education in new ways this past year.

These deadly shootings come on the heels of months of escalating violence toward the AAPI community.
 
We need to #StopAsianHate and refuse to tolerate this violence. Corporate special interests shouldn‚Äôt control our politics. 

Americans shouldn't struggle to cast their ballot and share their voice.

It's time to pass the #ForThePeople Act and strengthen our democratic process. The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy. It's how we speak up for what we believe in. But too many Americans still face barriers when trying to cast their vote. That's why we must pass the John Lewis #VotingRightsAct. It's 2021 ‚Äì but right now, LGBTQ Americans STILL face discrimination.

The Equality Act would help put a stop to that.

It's time for the Senate to follow the House's lead and pass the #EqualityActNOW. Heading to the White House with @SenatorShaheen to meet with @FLOTUS about how the #AmericanRescuePlan will help fully reopen schools and get NH through this devastating pandemic. Wish we could join her in Concord later today, but know she‚Äôll get a warm Granite State welcome. https://t.co/uOwt9r3fAW Our veterans put everything on the line to keep us safe, secure, and free.

https://t.co/g6k20CgJFj The latest COVID-19 relief package prioritized getting vaccines in more arms. 
 
That means billions of dollars to set up vaccination sites, ramp up testing, eliminate supply shortages, and more.

Now that's an investment in our recovery and our nation's future. Right now, veterans of all ages can sign up to get vaccinated if they get care at the Manchester VA. That's a great step. But we need to focus on vaccinating ALL veterans who have sacrificed so much for our country.

https://t.co/nNdrNRqSyk Congress passed additional COVID-19 relief last week that included: 

Housing assistance
Increased unemployment 
$1,400 stimulus checks for adults and children

‚òùAll of those things mean that more families will be able to stay in their homes and put food on their tables. Reminder: Wear a mask to protect yourself and the people around you. https://t.co/kz0SYk8SaY The COVID-19 relief package Congress just passed prioritizes vaccine distribution. That's because we know our nation can only move forward when Americans are vaccinated. People who experience disabilities should be able to access the COVID-19 vaccine ‚Äì that's why I'm pushing for increased support throughout the vaccine distribution process. https://t.co/4lmHSmCs5G Schools should pay for pencils, not PPE ‚Äì @fema needs to fully reimburse schools‚Äô expenses from the beginning of the pandemic for emergency COVID-19 materials.

And now our state is expected to receive more than $9 million to do just that. That's a big win for Granite State communities. Amid the pandemic, it's been even harder to detect signs of sexual abuse in kids. That's why it's more important than ever to pass the bipartisan Jenna Quinn Law I reintroduced with @JohnCornyn and help teachers and others better understand the signs of sexual abuse. https://t.co/FmYZssMPln .@DebHaalandNM is a historic nominee for @Interior Secretary ‚Äì and she has the experience to lead from day one.

And this time they'll include $1,400 for adults AND $1,400 for children.

That's a massive win for American families. The American Rescue Plan will help us get more vaccines in arms, get our children back in schools, put people back to work, and help families and small businesses pay their bills. Glad to see @POTUS sign this ‚Äì now let‚Äôs get this relief to the American people. https://t.co/KcNqZUFmGs A year ago today, @WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.

We should move to block new mergers &amp; acquisitions for the most powerful tech corps that are killing small biz I‚Äôm proposing amendments to take on corporate power, which the Dems are too scared to touch. We need to start by axing tax breaks for corps that ship jobs overseas and cheat our laws every day .@JoeBiden &amp; Dems are jamming through a budget that will be full of left-wing giveaways, risks Medicare funding and gives crumbs to working people.

"Heinrich, Martin",MartinHeinrich,TeamHeinrich,New Mexico,New Mexico,Senator," While I applaud the Biden administration's efforts to be transparent and thorough, we need to use the data and science available to weigh relative risk.

Remember that every Republican senator voted NO. The American Rescue Plan included nearly $40 billion for child care providers--the most significant investment in the child care sector since World War II. 

Remember that every Republican senator voted NO. Voting is a fundamental RIGHT. 

The filibuster is a Senate RULE. 

In a democracy, rights come before rules. The American Rescue Plan expanded support for nutrition assistance programs like SNAP and WIC to help families continue to put food on the table.

Remember that every Republican senator voted NO. The American Rescue Plan included billions in housing and rental assistance fund to ensure that families and individuals have a roof over their heads.

Remember that every Republican senator voted NO. The American Rescue Plan included $4 billion to protect essential farm and food workers and address major pandemic-related disruptions throughout the food supply chain.

Remember that every Republican senator voted NO. The American Rescue Plan included $20 billion to supercharge nationwide vaccine distribution and $50 billion for testing, genomic sequencing of variants, and contact tracing efforts so we can finally put an end to this pandemic.

Remember that every Republican senator voted NO. The American Rescue Plan included billions of dollars to build broadband infrastructure and help close the digital divide in rural and Tribal communities.

Remember that every Republican senator voted NO. As the first AmeriCorps alum to serve in the Senate, I‚Äôm proud to introduce legislation to mobilize the next generation of conservation workers through the new Civilian Climate Corps - to repair landscapes, grow our outdoor economy, &amp; strengthen our resilience to climate change. 88 years ago today, President Franklin Roosevelt established the Civilian Conservation Corps to provide thousands of Americans with work building infrastructure on our public lands. Today President Biden‚Äôs American Jobs Plan includes $10 billion for a new Civilian Climate Corps. Republicans have been short changing America‚Äôs infrastructure for decades.  Enough is enough.

That's why the American Rescue Plan included the greatest enhancement to the ACA since we passed it more than a decade ago. https://t.co/QGy7zEKxuL Proud to see New Mexico finally legalize responsible recreational cannabis use!

Next time I am hunting mule deer or javelina in southern New Mexico, I‚Äôll think of David and all he did to protect the wildlife and wild places of our incredible state.

And we will improve everyone's quality of life and create millions of good paying jobs in our communities. Too many families in New Mexico are living without internet access, clean water, and reliable electricity. The American Jobs Plan is our opportunity to change that. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to power our economic recovery and put Americans to work by solving our long-term climate challenge. I am thrilled that President Biden has placed clean energy and bold investments in America‚Äôs infrastructure at the forefront of his plan to build back better! It has been 50 years since most Americans returned from service in Vietnam. This is long overdue recognition of New Mexico's Vietnam veterans who answered the call of duty. https://t.co/yERekhNNwx New Mexico's newest national park is seeing record visitation! With so much room and open space, White Sands National Park is an ideal and safe place for families to get outdoors!https://t.co/5jK2eAwu0r It is critical that these important positions are filled in an expeditious manner. I look forward to working with the Biden administration to fill these roles ‚Äì and more ‚Äì in the weeks ahead.

And nearly 200,000 vaccine doses have been administered by the Navajo Area IHS. 

What heartening news! Thank you to all of the health care workers! The American Rescue Plan significantly strengthened the ACA by reducing premiums for plans on the exchange, providing incentives to expand Medicaid, investing $8.5 billion in rural health, and covering 100% of COBRA coverage to help those who have lost their jobs stay covered. Today is the 11th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act! The ACA has helped millions of Americans gain access to coverage and protections and made major progress in reducing racial and economic disparities in health care outcomes. Just confirmed Marty Walsh to run the Department of Labor. It‚Äôs been too long since we‚Äôve had a union brother at the helm there.

I was proud to secure $1.1 billion for Native education programs‚ÄîBIE schools, Tribal education agencies, and Native language preservation‚Äîin the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/MnAOpl8LDk We're starting to return toward normal (and in New Mexico back to the abnormal...) https://t.co/2rr5Or3PbA Honored to have @SecondGentleman in Albuquerque today on his and @VP's #HelpIsHere tour!
 
The American Rescue Plan is going to help New Mexicans begin returning to a life a lot more normal than what we experienced this past year. https://t.co/uPu0BVdHAj .@JudiciaryDems is taking up the Equality Act today. I'm proud to support this legislation because no American should fear harassment, discrimination, or risk losing their job because of who they are or who they love. #EqualityActNOW It is long past due for the millions of American citizens living in Puerto Rico to get the representation that they deserve. My home state of New Mexico had a similar struggle to achieve statehood. It took 50 New Mexico statehood bills and 64 years before we were finally admitted to the United States. The Puerto Rico Admission Act will create a clear and direct path to formally admit Puerto Rico as a state and will constitute Congress‚Äôs response to citizens in Puerto Rico and provide a formal offer of statehood. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to join @RepJenniffer and¬† @RepDarrenSoto and our bicameral coalition of @SenBrianSchatz, @RonWyden, and @SenAlexPadilla to introduce the Puerto Rico Admission Act in the Senate. Last November, a majority of Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood and for full voting representation in the United States. Congress now has a moral responsibility to respond.
https://t.co/MDNLpy1tMA What a welcome change. https://t.co/ukSP3r3xpz Tune in now as I join @SenatorLujan and @MayorKeller to highlight the local impact of funding I helped secure in the American Rescue Plan and how it will help deliver health and economic resources across New Mexico. https://t.co/2Njh1Uyzea 100 million vaccine doses delivered.
100 million checks delivered.  

This is what competence looks like. I am looking forward to hearing more tomorrow about @CannonAFB_ and @DeptofDefense‚Äôs plans to clean-up its PFAS ‚Äúforever chemical‚Äù contamination of nearby groundwater. https://t.co/C8ZVxbQYf2 Congratulations to our new Secretary of Interior, @RepDebHaaland! This is a proud day for New Mexico.
 
I know she will do an excellent job protecting our natural heritage for future generations. I look forward to working with her. It‚Äôs long past time to end the outrageous abuses of the payday lending industry in New Mexico. https://t.co/7DO0NJJtlt This is what competence looks like. https://t.co/e3hPsqf5hH Our goal is to bring policy education to college students across the state on issues like clean energy, public education, immigration reform, and more.

If you're interested, then we invite you to sign up! Learn more about the workshops and register here: https://t.co/eIJHFCdaiS üö® Attention college students in New Mexico! 

My office is excited to announce the rollout of our Policy Workshop Series. 

More information below üëá WATCH LIVE: I'm on the Senate Floor to speak in support of @RepDebHaaland for Secretary of @Interior. I'm eager for her to be confirmed so she can get to work protecting our natural heritage for future generations. https://t.co/6bOXKnEqta Tune in to today‚Äôs @EnergyDems hearing where I‚Äôll be pushing better practices to maintain economical, secure, and reliable energy grids.
¬†
https://t.co/VyUQpWdJDw WATCH: ERCOT‚Äôs mismanagement of the Texas power grid left millions without power recently after the state was devastated by a severe winter storm, but it should have never been this way. Help is on the way, New Mexico. This is the beginning of the end for this pandemic.
https://t.co/WkzYTwXqGs Great news: the American Rescue Plan just passed the House!
¬†
This legislation is the big and bold action we need to finally put our country on the path toward ending this pandemic.
¬†
Now let's get it to the President's desk. In December 2020, 6,181 megawatts of utility scale power capacity was added to the grid. 81% of that was from wind, 18% was from solar, and 1% was natural gas.

Over 8% of the additional capacity came from New Mexico's Sagamore Wind Farm.

The energy transition is here. https://t.co/EIFoevElnZ Republicans in Georgia are changing the rules to keep Black voters from exercising their right to vote. I‚Äôve never seen anything this shameful. https://t.co/IybWEfl6x0 How incredibly sad. I hear Tom Trowbridge‚Äôs voice so clearly. He was one of the best journalists in our state, and always asked probing questions. I am thinking of his family and loved ones tonight. https://t.co/Oftunt4ctg I look forward to working with Energy Secretary @JenGranholm to manage the nation's transition to a clean energy economy. I am inviting her to visit New Mexico to see the important work being done at our national labs as well as our diverse, growing energy industry. https://t.co/xCnouVk75k The contributions @LosAlamosNatLab make to science, national security, and New Mexico's economy can't be overstated. Their expansion to Santa Fe is an exciting move that will surely bring more benefits to our state. https://t.co/7lul9r9vvM Remember this. 

When America was down and out, Democrats stepped up, and Republicans were AWOL. 

Every single one. https://t.co/vj0fDl1hcm This report outlines how we could save 57,000 lives between now and 2050 by switching to zero emission technology for trucks and buses. Every year, the pollution from our tailpipes kills roughly 20,000 Americans. Let that sink in. 

Some of the worst offenders are school buses and delivery trucks. https://t.co/GJrDLLeXXW Congratulations! I bet LOBOmotorsports would give the carbon fiber solar powered car I built as an engineering student in the 90s a run for its money! You make me proud, @UNM. https://t.co/F7GFTbuNNs Broadband investment is critical infrastructure investment. Just like access to water, roads, railways, and electricity in the 21st century, broadband internet access determines which communities grow and thrive. Glad to see funding I helped secure go to Jemez Pueblo for a data center in Albuquerque that will deliver high-speed broadband internet to over 500 households in the pueblo. https://t.co/Iby9E1ya74 I‚Äôve been up for over 24 hours, and we‚Äôve slogged through countless amendments.

Soon it will be entirely worth it when we pass the American Rescue Plan. Onshore wind is resulting in big investments in New Mexico. Offshore wind can also help America BUILD BACK BETTER.

Put the pedal to the metal, Joe!
https://t.co/UhTEMgs3Jc 1 in 5 renters are behind on rent, and 1 in 10 homeowners are behind on their mortgage payments. The American Rescue Plan is going to provide urgently needed relief to help Americans stay stably housed during this pandemic. https://t.co/8TxBwllVir Thousands of New Mexicans are depending on unemployment insurance to get through the economic burden of this pandemic. 

We can‚Äôt let those benefits run out. 

The Senate needs to pass the American Rescue Plan, which will extend our emergency unemployment programs through August. https://t.co/cindOi3WeF COVID-19 tests and vaccines are critical to slowing the spread of the virus and rebuilding our economy.

We need to pass the American Rescue Plan because it includes:

‚úÖ $50 billion for testing/contact tracing
‚úÖ $20 billion for vaccine distribution
‚úÖ $10 billion to produce PPE Soon Democrats will vote to send direct assistance to working class Americans. 

Q: What will Republicans offer working class families?
A: Lip service.
https://t.co/foLyPWY4Mz Now more than ever, New Mexicans need access to affordable, quality health care. Luckily, the American Rescue plan will make that happen by increasing premium subsidies through the federal marketplace and expanding who qualifies for them. https://t.co/nM2fYPvlXo I am proud to vote today in @EnergyDems to advance @RepDebHaaland's historic nomination. She has always had an open door and an open mind. 

I encourage the full Senate to now vote to confirm her so she can get to work protecting our natural heritage for future generations. https://t.co/pZvoEbe5Sx Like too many utilities, Duke Energy is stuck in the past. If they build these natural gas generating stations, they will be stuck with stranded assets in a few years and their customers will pay with higher bills.
https://t.co/JnCliyHqCo When you ask someone to read you a book, it‚Äôs only fair to listen as they read it. 

So I assume Ron Johnson will be sitting in the chamber while he forces the Clerk to read the American Rescue Plan? New Mexicans need COVID-19 relief, and they need it now. The Senate needs to pass the American Rescue Plan so we can get $1,400 into people‚Äôs pockets and expand desperately needed unemployment benefits. The American Rescue Plan is going to provide the COVID-19 relief that Americans need, and Tribal communities are no exception.

This sweeping relief package provides over $31 billion to help Tribes recover from the impact of the pandemic. https://t.co/p3ZdKCl9sR ""'That attack, that siege, was criminal behavior, plain and simple, and it‚Äôs behavior that we, the FBI, view as domestic terrorism,' Wray told lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee."" https://t.co/iXpvho6tfg This is the kind of leadership we needed in 2020.

Last year, they sent a clear message by voting in favor of statehood.

Today, I'm proud to join @RepJenniffer &amp; @RepDarrenSoto to announce bipartisan, bicameral legislation to formally admit Puerto Rico as a state. https://t.co/zSkDmJDqaA No New Mexican should have to choose between their paycheck and their health, especially as we deal with a public health emergency. I encourage the New Mexico Senate to swiftly pass this bill and provide our workers with paid sick leave. So glad to see that HB 20, the Healthy Workplaces Act, has passed through the New Mexico House of Representatives. Thank you to State Reps @RubioNM35 @christine4nm @DaymonforNMHD23 @proybalcaballer and Senator @Sen_Mimistewart for your work on this critical bill. #nmlegis Prioritizing the first dose can result in better protection against new virus variants and help prevent serious illness or death. 
 
Now that production has increased, we can rely on our growing inventory to cover future second doses and help us work faster toward herd immunity. If we rethink our vaccine distribution strategy, we can maximize the number of Americans who are protected. 
 
Senator @ChrisVanHollen and I are calling on the Biden administration to prioritize first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. https://t.co/jXXO1Cv7lj The Republican Party is now the party of voter suppression. How anti-democracy is that? https://t.co/TU0DWl75EK Listen to the experts. Getting everyone vaccinated is how we get back on track. https://t.co/7uaM1lduyM I stand with New Mexico‚Äôs Asian American and Pacific Islander community and will keep fighting for a more just, equal society free of hate, and accepting of all. Intolerance in America must be eradicated. It is critical that every American choose unity over hate and learn to treasure our cultural differences‚Äînot let them divide us. https://t.co/DhVD2tfwT0 It's awesome to see @SandiaLabs tapping into the extraordinary expertise in our backyard by supporting creative, homegrown companies. https://t.co/fldF8AIO1s Like so many in the community, I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to spend time with Dr. Trujillo and learn from her.

üì∏: Jornada Elementary School, February 19, 2020 https://t.co/MsLGYjAaTa I am heartbroken about the tragic passing of Dr. Karen Trujillo, a devoted mom and compassionate leader who dedicated her life to New Mexico's students and teachers. Nature has been warning us for decades. 

The warnings are coming to an end. https://t.co/EDvRtUwsdp Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúmoron‚Äù now? https://t.co/cw4evRg9eV When you support NM restaurants, you're not just helping support the business, but also the incredible server, host, busser, kitchen, dish staffs and more. 
 
This is a team effort, and I'll continue my part to fight for legislative solutions to support NM's restaurant industry. I encourage everyone to keep ordering takeout, keep tipping your servers and delivery drivers, and help keep New Mexico's restaurant industry alive. It's time to double down on efforts to help NM restaurants.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm cosponsoring @SenatorSinema &amp; @SenatorWicker's RESTAURANTS Act to provide retroactive relief to NM‚Äôs hardest-hit, eligible establishments and offer solutions to help these restaurants weather the storm. Glad to see the #EqualityAct reintroduced in the Senate. I'll always stand with New Mexico's LGBTQ community and work to advance equality for every single American, no matter who they are or who they love. 

Let's get this thing passed. Excited to hear that the Trail of the Ancients has been added to @USDOT's list of national scenic byways. 

This route leads to so many cultural and historic treasures and this designation will be a major boost to NW New Mexico‚Äôs geotourism industry. https://t.co/SwLKqwAuBE Dark money in politics derails work on all kinds of important issues. From ensuring equal pay, to improving health care, or acting on the climate crisis... dark money touches it all.

If we want progress, we need to bring transparency to our elections and pass the #DISCLOSE Act. Clean and zero-emission vehicles are the future of transportation. I would urge Postmaster General DeJoy to go back to the drawing board. 

Otherwise, it will be hard not to view this as yet one more harmful decision by him to compromise the operations of the Postal Service. By choosing gas-powered vehicles, Postmaster General DeJoy is effectively locking in 25 years or more of USPS gasoline consumption and carbon pollution. 

This decision will also result in a massive waste of taxpayer dollars. The U.S. Postal Service‚Äôs decision to not replace its fleet with electric vehicles is a glaring mistake. 

Our transportation sector is a leading contributor to the climate crisis. https://t.co/AU2o0NuHol Just in case you believe all that BS about renewables causing the power problems in Texas, here is some data.

What happened in Texas is the result of electing people to run the government who don‚Äôt believe in government. https://t.co/Dhenl4YN1J There is a disconnect right now between transmission access and the best large-scale clean energy resources, which is why we need to move quickly to expand transmission capacity to connect centers of supply and demand in this new energy landscape. https://t.co/s2nQA0mPWp Civilizations are built on topsoil, and usually fall when it has been exhausted.

The good news: the American Rescue Plan's Restaurant Revitalization Fund sets aside $28.6 billion in grants for restaurants to pay their bills and keep their doors open. It's been a week since the #AmericanRescuePlan was signed into law. Checks are going into pockets, shots are going into arms, and help will be delivered to businesses and families everywhere. Stunning that in the year 2021, we're still seeing blatant voter suppression tactics deployed around the country.

We need to pass the #ForThePeopleAct ASAP to crack down on these shameful efforts and protect the right to vote. I was lucky enough to preside while my friend @SenatorWarnock delivered his powerful maiden floor speech. He‚Äôs right ‚Äî we need to make voting easier for all Americans. https://t.co/Y1Cg18VW5g Happy #StPatricksDay Colorado!
 
Did you know Leadville was known as the Little Ireland of Colorado? It became the home of thousands of Irish immigrants in the 1870s and 1880s! https://t.co/micdYHuwuE This is horrifying. My heart goes out to the families of those who were murdered in what appears to be a targeted hate crime.

Recently there's been an astronomical increase in violence towards AAPI individuals across the country.

We've got some snow on the way, Colorado! https://t.co/N0aFeaTlLS It's easy to hyperbolize on twitter, but I mean it when I say it: the American Rescue Plan will do more to lift struggling families out of poverty than any piece of legislation in a generation. This is a big deal. .@SenatorBennet's child tax benefit is game changing. It's going to cut child poverty in half and give families a reliable income source in these unreliable times.
https://t.co/ti7Bf2f1Sv I heard @GovofCO showed @BenteBirkeland that he's still got some of my beers leftover in the governor's mansion.

Today, one year after the @WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, there's light at the end of the tunnel. Congress has passed one of the most ambitious pieces of legislation in a generation. The American Rescue Plan will help those who need it most, especially our nation's poor and middle class. The American Rescue Plan just passed the House and is now heading to @POTUS's desk to be signed into law! Happy Colorado Aerospace Day to the nearly 200,000 Coloradans who work day in and day out to support our state‚Äôs thriving aerospace economy!

Bloody Sunday is a stain on our country's history. We need to make voting easier for ALL Americans. This bill will help end the pandemic while providing Colorado with
‚Ä¢ $1,400 stimulus checks
‚Ä¢ $6B for the state &amp; local towns, counties, &amp; municipalities
‚Ä¢ $1.2B for schools so they can reopen safely
‚Ä¢ a 6-month extension of unemployment benefits for out-of-work Coloradans It's been a long night, but we finally got it passed! Now time for a nap. üí§ https://t.co/5q1ftUCein We finally passed the COVID-19 relief package.

People need help now, and this bill provides it in the form of stimulus checks, vaccine resources, small business grants, and many other critical programs. It‚Äôs been just over 24 consecutive hours of wrangling the American Recovery Plan through the Senate. We are on the threshold of providing so many Americans essential support at this moment of great need. 

The virus will not defeat us! Republicans have kept us up all night by delaying much needed COVID relief. But it‚Äôll all be worth it once we finally get it passed.

It‚Äôs been a frustrating 12 hours, but that pales in comparison to the pain Coloradans have endured under this pandemic. Well folks, we're in for a long night here in the Senate...
¬†
I'll be here however long it takes to pass this COVID relief package. This COVID bill will:
‚òëÔ∏èextend unemployment benefits
‚òëÔ∏èaccelerate vaccine production &amp; distribution
‚òëÔ∏èhelp small businesses, including restaurants
‚òëÔ∏ècut child poverty by half (!)
 
Anyone standing in the way of this bill is keeping Colorado families from the help they need. Right now my Republican colleague is delaying a vote on the COVID relief bill by requiring the poor Senate clerks to read all 600+ pages out loud. That'll take about 10 hours.

So instead, tune in as I read letters from folks who are pleading for¬†help. https://t.co/dqUGjkY4Kq LIVE: @SenatorHick reads letters from Coloradans impacted by COVID https://t.co/dqUGjkY4Kq Today would have been my mom's 100th birthday.

We must fiercely pursue justice for Ahmuad, and root out racism and the systems that allow it to persist. Elijah was 23 years-old. He had gone to the convenience store to get an iced tea for his brother and was on his way home. His last words were apologetic and confused: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Ä¶It‚Äôs just that I can‚Äôt breathe correctly.‚Äù

He should be alive today. This report is painful to read. It makes clear there was no justifiable basis for stopping Elijah McClain or violently detaining him, and that the initial investigation into his death was deeply flawed.

He and his family deserve justice and accountability. https://t.co/TXVpG2g7PY Half a million lives have been lost to COVID-19 in the U.S., including nearly 6,000 here in Colorado.

John was a trailblazer who endured billy clubs and beatings for the scared right to vote. He reminded us of the power of ‚Äúgood trouble."" Let's honor his profound legacy by making voting easier and more accessible. Coloradans have been grappling with the effects of the pandemic for nearly a year now. We've got to stay focused on getting families, workers, and small businesses the relief they urgently need. We‚Äôre in this together. This week we remember the internment of Japanese Americans in our country. Xenophobia and racism toward Asian-Americans holds a shameful place in Colorado's past ‚Äî we must not allow it to mark our present or future.

Erika‚Äôs designation as a deputy assistant to the president demonstrates that the White House heard the AAPI community‚Äôs call for this role to be a senior level position. https://t.co/xkHaGKtOoo By passing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, Democrats and Republicans can come together to show that the United States Senate will not be a bystander to the wave of racist, anti-Asian violence in our country.

So let‚Äôs get it done, together. #StopAsianHate https://t.co/I7WBMXzpkn The Senate has a first step measure to #StopAsianHate on the floor today.

That‚Äôs the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act which will-
üîç require DOJ to speed up reviews of hate crimes
üìû expand public reporting efforts
üö® provide governments guidance to establish online reporting systems https://t.co/Yz525lymDp There were as many anti-Asian hate crimes in NYC in March-April 2020 as there were in the previous 4 years combined. Kristen Clarke was right today - we must stand up and confront this hate.

As a member of the @JudiciaryDems, I will work closely with my colleagues to review and confirm these highly-qualified nominees. I am gratified that, in contrast, President Biden has nominated a historic, diverse, and highly-qualified slate of nominees to fill these important judicial vacancies. https://t.co/5oOxhg0GlE Over his four years in office, Donald Trump nominated a series of extreme, unqualified, and ideologically-driven judges to lifetime appointments that will have an enduring impact on issues such as a woman‚Äôs right to choose, voting rights, and civil rights. Racism is never far below the surface in America, which is all too evident as the AAPI community has experienced escalating attacks and targeted violence during the pandemic.

We must confront the systems that allowed this hatred to fester and spread‚Äîexactly what @POTUS is doing. https://t.co/hAEFxssaK5 The bill not only condemns these racist acts, but allows victims to come forward safely without fear.

We hope to provide resources for communities to come together and fight intolerance and hate. This is no less than the victims deserve. We need to #StopAsianHate. Here's exactly what the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act does:

‚úÖRequires a DOJ point person to expedite review of COVID-19 hate crimes and reports of federal, state and local hate crimes

‚úÖ Requires DOJ issue guidance on hate crimes to state and local enforcement and collect that data Thanks to the support of @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi - Congress stands united against these attacks targeting the Asian community.

I urge both chambers of Congress to quickly pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and my resolution to condemn anti-Asian hatred. Racism has no place in this country.

Anti-Asian hate crimes are not just an Asian issue. Make no mistake: they're an American issue.

While a family emergency kept me from voting on her confirmation today, I remain confident that Secretary Haaland will lead with integrity and purpose. We need leadership at the top like President Biden calling these hate crimes out and putting together a process where these crimes can be reported. Like Joe said, it's wrong, it's un-American, and must stop.

What a contrast from our previous president. #StopAsianHate https://t.co/ZUva0GtfNI Republicans are pursuing ‚Äúthe most sweeping contraction of ballot access in the US since the end of Reconstruction.‚Äù Over 250 voter suppression laws intro'd just this year.

The House passed HR 1 last week. It's time for the Senate to deliver #ForThePeople.https://t.co/ZX2YKdQVIh It matters when our president condemns hatred and violence against Asian Americans.
 
Thank you President Biden for your strong words and moral leadership. You see the smile on my face? It's because President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law today‚Äîand millions of Americans will benefit.

Not a single Republican voted for the ARP. Apparently, they don't think their constituents deserve the help. Hold them accountable. https://t.co/7zzS8QmkPj Anti-Asian hate crimes increased by 150% in 2020. 150%!

@RepGraceMeng and I are introducing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act helping DOJ and communities come together to fight intolerance. We must all condemn this racism and raise awareness.

Stand up to hate, #StopAsianHate. https://t.co/P9mfAICpO5 One year ago, the world as we knew it changed forever when the WHO declared coronavirus a pandemic.

Over 29M cases, more than 500,000 lives lost to the virus. Today, we remember those lost and stand with those who continue to cope with unimaginable loss.

Better days are ahead. https://t.co/evSYcwFEdQ Vanita Gupta. Deb Haaland. Neera Tanden.

Highly qualified/respected women of color singled out by GOP senators for being outspoken and critical of Trump.

Is anyone else noticing a pattern in the types of nominees Republicans are singling out for criticism? #BREAKING: Democrats have passed one of the boldest relief plans for Americans in history. The American Rescue Plan is on the way to @POTUS's desk for his signature.

Help is finally on the way. https://t.co/jwoVG4OG9o As the Attorney General of the United States, Merrick Garland will be the people's lawyer not the President's. He's the leader we need to restore not only the independence and integrity of the DOJ, but the public's confidence in the department.

I'll be voting to #ConfirmGarland. We're learning more every day on the surge of hate crimes towards the AAPI community.

With experts like Lisa Monaco and Vanita Gupta, DOJ will work with community orgs who are often the first go-to for victims and improve data collection to see the full picture. #StopAsianHate https://t.co/uM8O90VtHT 3 months into 2021, we've finally reached #AAPIEqualPay.

This year the disparity is starker than ever: more than 1 in 4 AAPI women are front-line workers risking their lives, facing discrimination and racism‚Äîall while being paid less than their male counterparts. https://t.co/FNyIbiTLfw As I listened to some of the questions from my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee today, I want to note we‚Äôve been subjected to quite a lot of mansplaining in regards to Vanita Gupta‚Äôs position on race, religion, and more.

I commend you @VanitaGuptaCR on your calm responses. Our country needs to hold Senate Republicans accountable.

Republicans must answer their constituents on why they didn't lift a finger to get checks into people's hands, extend unemployment benefits, and help their states get out of this economic crisis. In honor of #InternationalWomensDay, congratulations to Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost and LTG Laura Richardson for their historic nominations to lead @US_TRANSCOM and @Southcom.

I look forward to the swift confirmation of both of these highly qualified officers. https://t.co/0A802bTIlQ This #InternationalWomensDay , I‚Äôm celebrating the progress we‚Äôve made towards representation within the US Senate.

I came to the Senate with a wave of women newly elected to Congress, breaking records and norms. Let's make sure that wave never stops and continue making history. https://t.co/zmIMTdDUUm I urge the House of Representatives to pass this legislation as soon as possible so that President Biden can sign it into law. By passing the American Rescue Plan, the Senate has taken bold action to put money into peoples‚Äô pockets, help our schools re-open safely, support state and local governments, speed vaccine distribution, expand health care access, and so much more. #COVID19 has touched every family and community in Hawaii and across our country.

With so many still out of work and unable to pay their mortgages and bills, it was crucial for the Senate to pass a sweeping relief bill that meets the urgency of the moment facing our country. Pleased to announce I'll be serving as the Chair of the @EnergyDems¬†Subcommittee on Energy.

I look forward to working with my colleagues to help America build clean, affordable, and reliable energy sources to create good jobs and help tackle climate change. https://t.co/ch2sIVRUiB Yesterday, a GOP lawyer again said the quiet part out loud telling the Supreme Court that allowing people to vote puts Republicans at a ‚Äúcompetitive disadvantage.‚Äù Is it any wonder Republicans have introduced over 250 voter suppression bills in 39 states this calendar year alone? https://t.co/cN7l7kOwaN Huge win. Proud to fight alongside Eric Gill, @uniteherehawaii, and @SenateDems to secure 100% COBRA payments in this relief bill so Hawaii hospitality workers can keep their health care. I will continue to fight to protect health coverage ‚Äì particularly during this pandemic. It's curious how GOP Senators who spent 4 years largely silent about Trump's lying, aggressive, sexist, and racist tweets are suddenly so offended by Neera Tanden.

Another example of how women's righteous indignation and justifiable anger are weaponized against us. https://t.co/xZtGe2MDso I stand with @POTUS and the workers of Amazon.

Every employee has the free and fair choice to join a union and no employer should be able to take that away. https://t.co/jSoFDOFWSb It was important for Christopher Wray to say he would never use language like ‚ÄúKung Flu or China Virus."" The words our leaders use matter.

Each of us has an obligation to stand up, confront bigotry, and #StopAsianHate. https://t.co/lfoo2hwR5R I'm in Tammy.

The American Rescue Plan would not only cut child poverty in HALF this year, it would also extend the increase in SNAP benefits for millions of children and families struggling to put food on the table.

@GillibrandNY and @SenatorHick, can I count you in? https://t.co/k2XDp011mM I was happy to support Merrick Garland as his nomination advanced out of the Judiciary Committee today. He's the type of leader @TheJusticeDept needs to reestablish its independence.

Now it's up to the Senate to do the right thing and confirm Judge Garland as Attorney General. https://t.co/gOWPSmNoYK This week's ‚Äò≈çlelo no‚Äòeau in honor of #HawaiianLanguageMonth reminds us there is no success without preparation.

To revive our nation‚Äôs economy, Congress must provide bold, aggressive relief like the American Rescue Plan to support displaced workers and struggling businesses. https://t.co/aRuOyf2RGF In 2021 how is it still possible to get evicted, thrown out of a restaurant, or denied a loan just because of who you are and who you love? Enough is enough.
 
I'm proud to stand with my friends @SenatorBaldwin, @SenJeffMerkley, and @SenBooker in reintroducing the #EqualityAct. https://t.co/5obQeU6njF Since #CitizensUnited, special interest spending and dark money in our elections has rigged the system against every day Americans.

It's time we know who's behind this spending and what these donors are getting in return. That's why we need to pass the #DISCLOSE Act. https://t.co/cVlZMUoD91 David Bernhardt's actions routinely benefitted the fossil fuel industry during his tenure as Interior Secretary.

But, I don‚Äôt recall my Republican colleagues asking him if he'd keep an open mind to other sources of energy.

Deb Haaland has assured us she will be fair and open. https://t.co/SM7oOkrhq4 As a member of @SenateSmallBiz, I‚Äôve been working with @SenatorCardin and others to make sure our smallest businesses and nonprofits have access to PPP.

Mom-and-pop businesses that have been severely impacted by the pandemic will get the help they need‚Äîthis is just the start. https://t.co/eAni6UADNf Deb Haaland's nomination would make her the first Native American Secretary of the Interior. As I told her‚Äîyour people were in our country long before the rest of us ever came here. The significance isn't lost on us.

Count me all in for #DebForInterior. https://t.co/0JG27hGyVC The past year has seen a surge in anti-Asian hate crimes, including the recent murder of an 84 year old man and countless assaults on others.
 
Unlike Trump‚Äôs Administration, AG nominee Merrick Garland acknowledged the issue and promised to do what he can to put a stop to it. Considering we just had a President who didn‚Äôt think the rule of law applied to him, it's interesting to hear so many of my Republican colleagues ask if Merrick Garland will follow the rule of law as Attorney General.

And of course, he will. As our nation faces a surge in hate crimes toward the AAPI community, this week's ‚Äò≈çlelo no‚Äòeau in honor of #HawaiianLanguageMonth guides us to be generous and kind to all.
 
The violence we face isn't just an AAPI issue‚Äîwe must all come together to condemn these forms of hate. https://t.co/DY29EPuTm1 The days of climate change denial in the White House are over.

Today, America rejoins the Paris Climate Accord and gets back to work addressing climate change on a global level. https://t.co/9DQOxkbbZm Today marks the 79th anniversary of FDR‚Äôs Executive Order 9066 paving the way for the illegal incarceration of Japanese Americans during WWII.

Born out of prejudice and fear, these dangers give rise to discrimination even now. We must stand and confront our history‚Äîtogether. https://t.co/qxBlVgOrsj The Trump administration‚Äôs cruelty toward immigrants must come to an end. Now is the time for reform which won't only reunite families, but keep them together.

I‚Äôm proud to co-sponsor the #USCitizenshipAct by my colleagues @SenatorMenendez and @RepLindaSanchez. https://t.co/kpgVys7A5y Donald Trump would be proud: Greg Abbott is trying to cover up his incompetence and total lack of leadership with a Big Lie.

His people are literally freezing and instead of taking responsibility, he's blaming windmills.

It's pathetic. Pleased to announce I will be serving as the Chair of the¬†@SASCDems Subcommittee on Seapower.

I look forward to partnering with RM¬†@SenKevinCramer¬†and my colleagues to sharpen the Navy and Marine Corps‚Äô readiness to meet existing and emerging threats to our national security. Recently, I had the opportunity to speak with @LisaMonaco,@VanitaGuptaCR, and @KristenClarkeJD. These women will not only excel at serving our country, but will help restore America's faith in the DOJ.

I look forward to working with them as a member of the Judiciary Committee. The House managers made their case. Donald Trump incited a violent insurrection and sent a murderous mob to lay siege to the US Capitol. We were all there. Everyone saw and heard what happened. Sad and shameful that only 7 GOP Senators had the courage to do the right thing. Trump lawyers threaten to subpoena 100 witnesses as long as not Trump. Time to subpoena and depose Trump. Today Trump's defense team played a montage of Democrats at the impeachment trial saying we're going to fight for immigrants, for students, and for people who are out of work.

When the former President uses the word fight‚Äîwe know he means fight for him, fight for Trump. In honor of #HawaiianLanguageMonth, this week's ‚Äò≈çlelo no‚Äòeau addresses the changes we must make to combat the climate crisis before it's too late.

With the help of organizations like @kupuhawaii, we can preserve our environment and natural resources for generations to come. https://t.co/EE5f8d5ywU"

Cosponsored a @marcorubio resolution condemning the People‚Äôs Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party and recommending U.S. govt responses. Read more: I continue to believe Xavier Becerra is a poor choice by @POTUS to head @HHSGov. Becerra brings with him an unapologetic record as an extreme partisan who doesn‚Äôt pause to pursue policies that harm pro-life causes, religious liberties, and other important freedoms. Honored to join @SenDuckworth bill on historic landmark status for Roberts Temple Church of God, the site of Emmett Till‚Äôs funeral. It'll build on work to ensure he and his family‚Äôs story, and their importance to the Civil Rights Movement, are never forgotten. @SenatorWicker Tune in today at 2:00pm CDT as @NASAStennis runs its eighth test of the Green Run series to ensure #Artemis core stage is ready to launch. Great to see Mississippi play such a vital role in our nation‚Äôs mission to return to the moon! https://t.co/HtUcbqJWuF @NASAArtemis https://t.co/4J2tZq5A5b Firearms laws can be reformed, just not in any way that threatens our #SecondAmendment rights. Joined @SenatorMarshall on 2 bills which would both create incentives for more people to learn firearm safety and eliminate outdated federal red tape &amp; taxes on some guns. Pleased @RepTrentKelly bill to name the US post office on Main Street @MyTupelo after MS native &amp; Vietnam War Veteran Col. Carlyle ‚ÄòSmitty‚Äô Harris is now cleared for Senate consideration. @SenatorWicker and I urged swift committee action in a letter last week. More: God loves every one of us, and we should all be treated with kindness, respect &amp; dignity. But ultimately, by pretending biological females &amp; transwomen are the same for all purposes‚Äîwhich the misnamed Equality Act would do‚Äîwe will move girls &amp; women backward rather than forward. Please be sure you‚Äôre able to receive updates on potential tornado warnings as severe weather moves through Mississippi. Stay vigilant and be prepared to move to a safe location if placed under a tornado warning. https://t.co/qxX7ldjKVi The growing #BorderCrisis is the result of failing @POTUS immigration policies. Freezing border wall $$$ making it worse. @SenatorWicker &amp; I joined @SenCapito letter to @USGAO challenging Pres. Biden's suspension of border wall funding/construction without lawful justification. Much of MS will have the possibility of strong tornadoes, hail and damaging winds tomorrow. As always, stay up to date with the latest forecasts so you can #BePrepared. https://t.co/Gs8rnvVUpW My legislation would provide federal assistance to get Jxn on the path to providing basic services its citizens require &amp; deserve. It's a responsible &amp; worthwhile plan that'll require the support of @SenateDems &amp; @WhiteHouse to get it done, &amp; I look forward to their cooperation. Jxn's water woes became a crisis with the Feb. ice storm, but the hard truth is that the crisis was just waiting to happen after decades of neglect. I‚Äôve introduced legislation to authorize a federal approach to help the @CityOfJxnMS work toward fixing the problem... A strong @USNavy is necessary to ensure our national &amp; economic security. Joined MS &amp; ME lawmakers in a letter seeking @SecDef &amp; @DepSecDef commitment to support @DeptofDefense budget increases to help keep pace with China on shipbuilding. Read it: Look forward to serving as the Ranking Member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety and Security as @SenateAgGOP addresses the policies needed to strengthen the agricultural sector and its importance to our economy. Still dealing with financial uncertainty due to #COVID19, MS taxpayers now face the govt‚Äôs inability to deliver refunds lawfully owed to them. To fix the problem, we‚Äôve asked @IRSnews Commissioner Rettig to clear a large backlog of '19 tax returns before the 2020 deadline. O give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; for His steadfast love endures forever.
Psalm 107:1 Reminder that we #SpringForward tonight as #DaylightSavingTime begins. I, for one, don‚Äôt look forward to losing an hour of sleep. The @marcorubio Sunshine Protection Act would make DST permanent, and eliminate the need for us to change our clocks. https://t.co/GWXWOQRGml Another nice #pandemic story out of Panola County of Mississippians doing what Mississippians do--helping one another. https://t.co/4sQSyVkWKr #Pandemic related stress is resulting in a serious uptick in mental health and substance abuse cases. ~$20.5M in #COVID19 funding from last December headed to MS to address these problems. It‚Äôs important there is no delay in tackling this serious issue affecting many lives. Happy 109th Birthday @girlscouts! üéÇ. For over a century this community has encouraged girls throughout the world to be leaders. Not to mention the amazing #girlscoutcookies everyone looks forward to enjoying each spring! #NationalGirlScoutDay üíö https://t.co/rYzcsTFgkK Thoroughly enjoyed visiting today with Jacob Pearson of Corinth &amp; Archer Taylor of Petal, our MS delegates to the United States @SenateYouth Program. They‚Äôre both bright young men who will represent us well at next week‚Äôs 59th annual USSYP Washington Week. https://t.co/awJcDY57Iq The fight to protect #SecondAmendment rights is unending. @RepGosar &amp; I introduced the GRIP Act to stop fed funds from supporting gun owner registries &amp; to protect the rights and personal information of law-abiding citizens who own or purchase firearms legally. Read more: Our nation is entering into a precarious time when religious liberties can be so easily trampled. The Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act would protect child welfare providers, who hold fast to their religious beliefs or moral convictions. @SenatorWicker More: MS is a major rice producer &amp; Iraq is an important destination for American-grown rice. I joined colleagues in sending letters to encourage @SecBlinken &amp; Amb. Yasseen to work on increasing US rice exports to Iraq. @JohnBoozman @SenatorWicker Read the letters here: In an economic recovery, states shouldn't be limited in ways to boost their economies. Dem‚Äôs $1.9T #COVIDRelief bill says explicitly ‚Äòstates shall not use the funds‚Äô to change state tax laws. An egregious federal overreach that could affect MS. The devil‚Äôs in the details. https://t.co/GWl7Kep1Me In light of #WomensHistoryMonth, let us remember and honor the courage, sacrifice, and the determination exercised by Mississippi‚Äôs Fannie Lou Hamer. Enjoy this very good @NEHgov article on her incredible story: https://t.co/uOVM43G3ty The public safety improvements, economic benefits, &amp; the wellbeing of the American people are all excellent reasons to embrace year-long #DaylightSavingTime. The Sunshine Protection Act would give us an immediate &amp; long-term boost after a terrible #pandemic year. @marcorubio Thank you to all Mississippi @AmeriCorps members who step up and dedicate valuable time to serve our communities! Your effort and commitment does not go unnoticed. Sending you all of the #AmeriThanks on this #AmeriCorpsWeek! https://t.co/r1poaNP4f1 Happy #InternationalWomensDay  to all the amazing women! I am a constantly motivated and inspired by my daughter, mother, sister, colleagues, friends, and the women who contribute so much to improving the world. #IWD2021 https://t.co/8d21jtFoj1 The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the command of the LORD is clear, enlightening the eye. Psalm 19:9 What @POTUS and congressional Democrats have produced is bad policy. It opens the door to a radical liberal agenda thinly veiled as #COVIDrelief. Less than 9% of $1.9 TRILLION for fighting the virus, more vaccines.  Read my full statement below. The Democrats‚Äô vote to dismiss the Hyde Amendment to allow taxpayer-funded abortions is more evidence of how off the rails this so-called #CovidReliefBill really is. https://t.co/WopJm8Ckyb Couldn‚Äôt be prouder of @nationalguardMS for its work with @msdh @MSEMA throughout #COVID19. It‚Äôs been a hard year, but the resilience of Mississippians and our small businesses is seeing us through. https://t.co/0pMbhtcTBO We can and should do this #CovidReliefBill just the way we did the others: on a bipartisan basis. Let‚Äôs move forward. 

https://t.co/DOcjbyXomn https://t.co/SDX7nzcbzY .@POTUS Chief of Staff slips on truth, saying $1.9 TRILLION PLAN is ""the most progressive domestic legislation in a generation."" Yep ‚Äì this ‚ÄòCovid Relief‚Äô bill is really just a massive liberal policy spending bill, accomplishing virtually nothing to finish the #coronavirus fight. https://t.co/jmi7m4sgKa Great news for MS: $6.99M @USArmy contract to Starkville-based @CamgianMicro to advance technologies to stop unwanted UAS incursions and improve the Army‚Äôs ability to detect, track, and stop UAS threats. Enjoyed a 2/2020 briefing on its dynamic work. After 5 bipartisan #COVID19 relief packages, Dems are pushing through a ~$2 trillion liberal policy wish list under the guise of #CovidRelief. I would have easily supported a new, targeted package where it‚Äôs needed. We should be moving forward together, not like this. https://t.co/LLlFCsAB1r I look forward to working with Kari Wilkinson in her new role as Ingalls Shipbuilding President for @HIIndustries. Thank you, Brian Cuccias, for your good and important achievements to advance shipbuilding over the years. Congratulations to both of you. https://t.co/72fETjXyPX https://t.co/dxPqeyudNk Rejoining the Paris climate agreement is a mistake &amp; Americans don‚Äôt want to pay for it. ‚ÄòNo Taxpayer Funding for Paris Climate Agreement Act‚Äô would keep MS families/businesses safe from having to pay higher energy bills and restrictions on their future. @SenatorWicker Read more: Banks &amp; FSPs cannot refuse law-abiding businesses service, especially for political reasons. @SenKevinCramer Fair Access to Banking Act would ensure banking institutions operate on an impartial basis, &amp; establishes penalties for those that put political agendas over the law. Fertilizer supplies have tightened across the U.S. and phosphate fertilizer prices are up 25% or more, which is a big problem for MS farmers &amp; ranchers. I joined @JerryMoran in calling on the ITC to oppose imposing countervailing duties on phosphate fertilizers. Read it here: Honored to take on the role of Ranking Member for the Water &amp; Power Subcommittee of @EnergyGOP. Look forward to working on issues that will surely arise as @POTUS pivots to a climate change agenda. MS livelihoods will be affected by how well we handle these challenges. Enjoyed the opportunity to visit with @nkf @NKF_Advocacy this morning. The need for access to home dialysis has only been highlighted by the #pandemic. Thanks so much for sharing and visiting today. https://t.co/YMrtsV6F9A Just 1% of the Dems‚Äô $1.9 TRILLION ‚Äòrelief‚Äô bill, would go to vaccinations. Less than 9% would go to directly fight #COVID19. The other 90%? Liberal wish list items, such as blue state bailouts, Planned Parenthood, union pensions, and on and on‚Ä¶ https://t.co/nozzo05cO0 Ten Mississippi Schools named among the nation‚Äôs best for #veterans and military-connected students. Thrilled to see so many MS schools recognized for their dedication to those who serve our nation. Keep up the good work! https://t.co/OnXccrzChp @Mil_Friendly https://t.co/yIXMPlczqo Congress has already provided $4T in #COVID19 relief. Much of that $$$ hasn‚Äôt even been tapped into yet. Instead of determining where more help is needed &amp; ensure the existing resources are spent effectively, Dems are ramming through another $1.9T bill on a partisan basis. https://t.co/Og283KjLsw March is #WomensHistoryMonth, a time to celebrate all the brave, pioneer women who have worked relentlessly, and accomplished so much throughout American history.

Listen to him!‚Äù Matthew 17:5 Crucial to US national security for @DeptofDefense to assert a solid commitment to @USNavy shipbuilding requirements in order to deter Chinese provocation. Read the letter @SenatorWicker @MarcoRubio @MarshaBlackburn @SenRickScott &amp; I sent to @SecDef here: Happy to share this truly heartwarming story. Spectacular work by the @UMMCnews staff to save another precious life. https://t.co/2tZKuFcS6G Broad participation in our electoral process is not only ideal, but necessary. Still, everyone needs to have confidence that our elections are conducted in a consistent/transparent manner. @SenRickScott @SenJohnBarrasso @SenLummis &amp; I offer the ‚ÄòSave Democracy Act.‚Äô See more: ~$5.26M headed to MS to boost rural #telemedicine &amp; #distancelearning across the state, which is essential as we work our way through the #pandemic. These @usdaRD projects will help students, seniors, businesses and many others in the years to come when #COVID19 is behind us. Very pleased to see the @USArmy tapping MS @winchester  workers to supply ammo for our soldiers. This five-year contract is great news. @VisitOxfordMS  https://t.co/e9kxN3yreG .@POTUS must not repeat the Obama Administration's mistakes. We mustn't lift sanctions on the Iranian regime until it abandons its nuclear ambitions &amp; ends its support for terror. Joined @SenTomCotton &amp; others in voicing strong opposition: Read: We're in the middle of a #pandemic &amp; rather than nominate a medical professional or anyone with a healthcare background, @POTUS nominated Xavier Becerra. His ‚Äúexperience‚Äù is filing lawsuits to go against anything that is #prolife. Pres. Biden should withdraw his nomination. Thank you, @CongPalazzo, for your dedicated service to our nation! https://t.co/DJ9kaEP9Ux Loved the opportunity to join @SenatorTimScott and @ChrisCoons at Senator Scott‚Äôs 5th annual #HBCUFlyIn to discuss innovation, access to capital and job creation! #RustCollege @tougaloocollege @AlcornStateU @_TigerNation @JacksonStateU @MVSUDEVILS https://t.co/JzcHzOf1DN Legal protection is needed for #prolife healthcare workers, who shouldn‚Äôt be penalized for refusing to participate in abortions. @SenatorLankford‚Äôs Conscience Protection Act would protect healthcare providers from discrimination for their moral/religious beliefs. Mississippians need greater assurances that their jobs will be given greater priority under Biden public lands/energy policies. I asked Rep. Haaland for answers for Mississippians whose jobs could be lost now, for the promise of future climate-related work. I voted to confirm Tom Vilsack because he understands the unquestionable importance of American agriculture to Mississippi, our nation, and the world. Look forward to working with him. https://t.co/3cC1zo2ZZA Kudos to Jake Pearson and Archer Taylor on their selection to represent MS at the 59th annual @SenateYouth Program. This year‚Äôs program will be a bit different as it is wholly virtual, but I'm confident they will represent our state well, &amp; I look forward to visiting with them! As we move forward from the Jan. 6th attack, we must ensure the @CapitolPolice have the support/capacity to protect the Capitol, visitors, staff &amp; lawmakers against future threats. A Joint Cmte Hrg today began a bipartisan effort to discover facts &amp; set a path forward. https://t.co/e5vOfHKuuK The @DLAMIL has awarded a $86.1M contract to @MerchantsFS in Jackson to deliver foods to military facilities in MS and LA over the next 4 years. Very pleased to see a Mississippi firm awarded this competitive contract. Crossing the somber milestone of 500,000 Americans lost to the #pandemic gives us a chance to renew our vow to beat this truly devastating disease. I pray for those who have lost loved ones to the #coronavirus and for brighter days ahead. ""Look to the LORD and His strength; seek His face always."" 1 Chronicles 16:11 Thank you @TVAnews @electriccoopsms and all MS utility companies for working diligently to get and keep the lights &amp; heat on during this major arctic freeze. https://t.co/iqbTtqG3JR #HappyBirthday to the @USCGReserve!

Take a look at my latest newsletter to see how it‚Äôs going: Female athletes of all ages should be allowed fair &amp; equal competition, which means competing against other women.

Officer Goodman, along with other heroic officers who protected the seat of democracy, are great Americans. Honored to be named ranking member on the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee. The 50-50 split in the Senate will not diminish my determination to use my committee assignments to work on behalf of Mississippi and the nation. $11.6M in @FAANews grants are headed to 63 MS airfields experiencing economic disruption due to #COVID19. This $$$ will help support operations &amp; maintenance needs at airports across the state, which is even more important now as local economies deal with the ongoing #pandemic. Tens of thousands of Mississippians suffer from pre-existing conditions &amp; worry about being penalized because of their health . We are reintroducing @SenThomTillis Protect Act to shield them from that threat. I hope this is an area in which a divided Congress can work together. Mississippians are singing the praises of the @nationalguardMS for their extraordinary work in vaccinating communities to help fight the #pandemic. Just another example of how well they answer the call of duty. THANK YOU! https://t.co/HhopIGcP7A Welcome home @nationalguardMS 1st Battalion 204th Air Defense Artillery Regiment from missions in both D.C. and Europe!¬†It was great to visit with you during your mission in D.C.

Congrats to Mitch Stringer and Janel Carothers! https://t.co/cdS8TGrNHC For 45 years, the law has prohibited using your taxpayer dollars for abortions. I joined 47 colleagues in signing a letter to @SenSchumer pledging to block any legislation that undermines the #HydeAmendment or any other pro-life protections. Read the letter here: I continue to pray for Hancock Co. Sheriff Lt. Michael Anthony Boutte, his family and community. Such a tragic loss. His memorial service will be live streamed Tuesday at 11:30am CT: https://t.co/xutsGOa6j1 https://t.co/gNCwvkuglC A long night of budget votes &amp; we learned a lot:
Dems:
‚ùå OK w/ #StimulusChecks for noncitizens
‚ùå OK w/ tax breaks for Blue States
‚ùå OK w/ more $ to states that lowballed LTC #COVID19 deaths
‚ùå OK w/ Teacher Unions over reopened schools
‚ùå OK w/ maybe packing the Supreme Court I voted against the Senate Democrat budget resolution, a framework that‚Äôs really a backdoor scheme to pass some big government ideas that have little to do with defeating #COVID19. We won't give up on Sarah's Law. https://t.co/d5mImY24Ao Democrats are using a budget procedure to get around 60-vote requirements. To protect our #2ndAmendment rights, I also introduced another amendment to prohibit federal funding for state firearm ownership databases. Senate now voting on amendments to flawed a Democrat budget plan. I‚Äôve offered several amendments to improve it, including one to ensure equal #COVID19Vaccine distribution to rural and underserved areas. Mississippi‚Äôs Sarah Thomas will go down in sports history on Sunday as the first woman to officiate the Super Bowl.

Congratulations and keep up the good work! https://t.co/NPCZPK5BSv https://t.co/wMpUa9i5Tt The @POTUS's early energy policy actions are a cause for concern and not a source of unity. They signal a troubling willingness to sacrifice strategic industries that are important to our economy and for the jobs they provide. Watch my floor speech: Grateful for the support of @SenJohnBarrasso, @MarshaBlackburn, @SenCapito, @MikeCrapo, @JohnCornyn, @SenJoniErnst, @SenatorFischer, @SenatorHagerty, @SenJohnHoeven, @JimInhofe, @JerryMoran, @SenatorRisch, @marcorubio, @SenThomTillis, and @SenToddYoung As the Senate debates a very big, far-reaching budget bill, I‚Äôve reintroduced a constitutional balanced budget amendment requiring @POTUS &amp; Congress to enact annual balanced budgets. It would compel our nation‚Äôs leaders to make difficult choices to get our fiscal house in order. .@CapitolPolice Officer Brian Sicknick lost his life defending the U.S. Capitol and protecting democracy on January 6th. Today, we honor him, his heroic sacrifice, and the colleagues and family he leaves behind.

The $32M from @FEMA will increase the ability of @msema to assist the state‚Äôs inoculation effort, and for that we are all thankful. Setting the stage to halt development of our energy resources will harm growth &amp; raise costs, hurting low-income families &amp; small businesses across the nation. Congress should assert itself on critical energy development policies, which is the intent of @SenLummis's POWER Act. MS has mandated E-Verify use for almost 10 yrs to verify worker eligibility &amp; ensure legal workers fill available jobs. I back @ChuckGrassley's Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act to support American workers &amp; stop illegal immigration into our nation. More: There‚Äôs a certain lack of common sense for anybody charged with heinous crimes, let alone an illegal immigrant, to be carelessly released back into society. @SenJoniErnst's Sarah‚Äôs Law closes loopholes in our immigration system that allow violent criminals to escape from justice. Join the virtual @March_For_Life here: https://t.co/Hrwd7aJ3mv We are united by the right to *life*, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

And yet, @POTUS has rescinded the #prolife ‚ÄòMexico City Policy‚Äô which prohibited federal funds from supporting abortions abroad. https://t.co/SjVyGjX5jd Protecting the dignity of life extends to protecting the unborn, especially from the point at which the innocent child is capable of feeling pain. @LindseyGrahamSC's Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would correctly establish these standards on a nationwide level. Great news! Congrats! https://t.co/JRMEDNshcC I am pleased to renew this important effort with @boblatta and others supporters. @SBAList @nrlc @March_for_Life @USCCB @FRCdc Do-It-Yourself abortion drugs pose dangers to women.

Cosponsoring @SenJoniErnst resolution urging the Senate to uphold the Trump administration‚Äôs Navigable Waters Protection Rule. Our farmers, businesses and communities want and deserve certainty, not flagrant #WOTUS regulatory overreach. @SenatorWicker .@POTUS actions to stop oil &amp; gas production will cut well-paying jobs &amp; royalty revenues that allow states like MS to fund conservation projects. The Conservation Funding Protection Act would protect jobs, energy exploration &amp; conservation efforts along the @msgulfcoast. On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember the Jewish people and the millions of victims lost to Nazi atrocities. We commit to #neverforget and vow #neveragain. https://t.co/zS003TKHZb Great news: @CBP has issued $21.2M contract to begin production of MS-built Light Enforcement Helicopters.

Pleased to join @SenatorWicker and others on @SenatorTimScott‚Äôs National #SchoolChoiceWeek Resolution.

As a conservative, I am grateful for the good accomplished by President Trump and his administration. I believe our national path forward can, and should, build on those achievements in the months and years ahead. I wish @POTUS @JoeBiden &amp; @VP @KamalaHarris well as they undertake the serious challenges facing our beloved country. I am committed to working with the new administration and my colleagues to find common-ground solutions overcoming these challenges. Pleased with the new allocation of $63.6 million for @usacehq projects in MS to benefit public health, safety, and economy.

It's the long-awaited green light to move forward with at last bringing better @VicksburgUSACE flood control to the South Delta. I joined @SenatorWicker @SenTomCotton &amp; others to urge @SBAgov Administrator @SBAJovita to prevent Planned Parenthood affiliates from receiving illegal loans under Second Draw #PPP.

"Inhofe, James ",JimInhofe,,Oklahoma,Oklahoma,Senator," U.S. manufacturers keep the machine we call America going in good times and trying times. I'm glad to join @RoyBlunt in introducing the Permanently Preserving America‚Äôs Investment in Manufacturing Act of 2021 and urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation quickly. I welcome tough measures against Russia‚Äîbut sanctions and diplomacy alone, without a strong U.S. national defense, will not deter further aggression. My full statement on the Biden administration‚Äôs announcement ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/ynIbywBQTx This week, @SenatorLankford, @RepFrankLucas and I urged President Biden to support jobs in Hinton, Okla., and suspend his executive order to close down prisons, including the important Great Plains Correctional Institution, located in Hinton.

Read the full letter below ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/6dx6JssejF We are eager to hear from the commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Miller, about current conditions in Afghanistan and expect him to testify before @SASCGOP, @SASCDems, @HASCRepublicans &amp; @HASCDemocrats later this month. Ranking Member @RepMikeRogersAL and I hope we can come together once again to do the same on the approach to Afghanistan. Republicans and Democrats came together to work with the previous Administration on a different approach to Syria when a full drawdown was considered in 2019, for exactly the same reason: the best way to protect American families at home is to defeat the terrorists overseas. The Annual Threat Assessment, prepared by the Biden administration &amp; released publically just last week, is unequivocal: ""The Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield &amp; the Afghan Government will struggle to hold the Taliban at bay if the coalition withdraws support."" The United States entered Afghanistan as a result of 9/11, and it is irresponsible to leave when conditions on the ground would lead to a civil war in Afghanistan and allow the country to become a safe haven for terrorists once again. As the Ranking Members on the congressional Armed Services Committees, @RepMikeRogersAL and I urge @POTUS to reconsider his irresponsible calendar-based approach to withdrawing from Afghanistan. Read our full statement here ‚Üì https://t.co/59w5WczLLw While I have considerable respect for Brenda Mallory, she has been selected to carry out the far-left agenda of the Biden administration and I cannot support her confirmation. Under the Biden administration, they will work to reverse the progress we have made over the past four years bringing jobs back to Oklahoma, cutting harmful, costly regulations and conducting timely environmental reviews. While the Council On Environmental Quality is not as well-known as the EPA, CEQ is responsible for almost all significant environmental reviews‚Äîincluding those for pipelines and highways. Happy birthday, @USAFReserve! My thanks to the brave #ReserveCitizenAirmen who have served our nation ‚Äì ready to #flyfightwin ‚Äì over the last 73 years. https://t.co/BAxZVBwSnk My top priority on @SASCGOP is making sure our military has what it needs to defend the country ‚Äì especially from China and Russia.

Today, I asked @US_EUCOM &amp; @US_TRANSCOM commanders what budget and policies would best support their missions.

https://t.co/Cl3ZakfELF I‚Äôve always said any withdrawal from Afghanistan must be conditions-based. @POTUS‚Äôs decision to use an arbitrary date for withdrawal is clearly political - not to mention reckless and dangerous. My full statement ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/2cOJGaPv1w I appreciate that @POTUS also recognized the importance of the National Cyber Director role and intends to nominate Chris Inglis for the job. I look forward to considering this nominee in the coming weeks. We created the National Cyber Director position in the #FY21NDAA to better coordinate cybersecurity efforts across the entire federal government. As we‚Äôve seen in the aftermath of the SolarWinds and Microsoft cyber hacks, there‚Äôs no shortage of work to be done. Even a number of my Dem colleagues agree President Biden‚Äôs policy changes have caused this crisis. In Feb 2021, CBP had 100,441 border encounters, amounting to a 173% increase from the 36,687 encounters in Feb 2020 ‚Äî just one year prior. How could anyone deny this is a crisis? It is baffling to think that the Biden admin would clearly incentivize illegal immigrants to bypass the legal process, allowing illegal immigrants charged with heinous crimes to be released into American communities and allow asylum abuse to run rampant.
 
https://t.co/6CqlGUObIg They won‚Äôt call it what it is: the Biden Border Crisis. 
 
My @tulsaworld op-ed:
 
https://t.co/6CqlGUObIg Everyone from Biden to newly confirmed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the White House press secretary are failing to acknowledge the border situation‚Äôs severity, calling the skyrocketing border encounters a ‚Äúchallenge.‚Äú We know a number of migrants are coronavirus positive as well, adding additional pressure to our communities still recovering from the pandemic.

Read my full thoughts about the Biden Border Crisis below.
 
https://t.co/6CqlGUObIg The current administration has prioritized a radical rollback of concrete, commonsense policies for the sole purpose of sticking it to Republicans, all while thousands of people pour across the southern border. 
 
https://t.co/6CqlGUwAjG One of President Biden‚Äôs first official acts of his presidency‚Äîsuspending the border wall funding and construction‚Äîresulted in a compromised border and a humanitarian and security crisis.
https://t.co/6CqlGUObIg Our military is playing catch-up to our strategic competitors. The Chinese military is on a modernization sprint and we're crawling forward. We can't spend our way out of the problem, but we can spend too little to give ourselves a chance. https://t.co/yEtJUFM2iK https://t.co/MeLxYBI5lh https://t.co/XaWnLkPjfK I was thrilled to celebrate this momentous occasion alongside the Grand Lake community today. Oklahoma‚Äôs thriving aviation and aerospace industries are not done growing yet and I am excited to see this newly refinished runway as part of a larger growth opportunity for Oklahoma. https://t.co/RcNYtbDBd6 Cutting our defense budget completely undermines DC Democrats‚Äô tough talk on China &amp; calls into question the administration‚Äôs willingness to confront the Chinese Communist Party. My statement on @POTUS's budget w/ @LeaderMcConnell, @LindseyGrahamSC, @SenRubioPress &amp; @SenShelby: https://t.co/jpsbNmORsD When it comes to pushing back on Beijing, a strong military will make sure our diplomatic, economic, and technological efforts succeed too. If @POTUS is serious about China, his upcoming defense budget needs to show that. https://t.co/yEtJUFuqUa Our military weapons systems have grown more complex. But so have commercial aircraft &amp; cars, and the timeline to field those has not grown much or even decreased. Yet our weapons systems take longer to field each year! This is a management &amp; process problem @DeptofDefense. https://t.co/6Ev7iqHsKa Securing our borders is an issue we should all get behind ‚Äî every nation needs borders. Unfortunately, the Biden admin doesn‚Äôt seem to agree. 
 
Read my full thoughts in my @tulsaworld op-ed:
https://t.co/6CqlGUObIg It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. Former President Trump took real steps to secure the border by building the wall &amp;made enforcing immigration laws a priority. As a result, illegal crossings in the Yuma Sector decreased by 87% from FY19 to FY20 in areas w/ a new border wall system. The U.S. should not return to the failed Iran Deal. Troubled by @USEnvoyIran‚Äôs apparent push to do exactly that. My colleagues @SenRubioPress, @SenToomey &amp; @SenToddYoung joined me in a letter to @POTUS urging him to work with us on a better path forward. https://t.co/5WG63DCRtl Border patrol is completely inundated. Reports indicate that nearly all border patrol sectors are above 100% capacity, with some sectors double, triple or even at significantly higher levels of overcapacity.
 
Read my @tulsaworld op-ed here:
 
https://t.co/6CqlGUObIg .@SecDef &amp; @DepSecDef agree the 2018 National Defense Strategy largely hits the mark. Now we need the budget to match that strategy ‚Äì and that means sustained growth to prepare our military for great-power competition with China. My message to @POTUS ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/yEtJUFM2iK I still can‚Äôt understand why the Pentagon‚Äôs budgeting system remains fundamentally unchanged since it was built in the 1960s. I‚Äôm glad my colleague #SASC Chairman @SenJackReed held a briefing to start the process of looking at this problem. https://t.co/1MIHU3aksz Freedom isn‚Äôt free. No one knows that more than America‚Äôs #GoldStarSpouses. Take a moment today to reflect on their sacrifice and honor their strength and resilience. 

To those who lost a spouse in the line of duty: We will never forget your sacrifice. https://t.co/kAgtgyzbX0 I encourage Democrats to join me in fighting for all of the unborn‚Äîincluding those in the Down syndrome community. They deserve protection. They deserve a voice. They deserve someone to stand up for them‚Äîbefore it‚Äôs too late. 

My @BartlesvilleEE op-ed. ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/dSRf4Vs5q2 This isn‚Äôt about health care‚Äîit's about protecting the most vulnerable. These are real people, with real futures ahead. All children should be given the chance at life, &amp; our friends in the Down syndrome community are no exception. 

My full thoughts. ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/dSRf4Vs5q2 With all of the problems we have out there with the pandemic, it's easy to forget about the important things. Thankfully, during Easter time, we remember what really is important. He is risen and we celebrate that today. Happy Easter! https://t.co/hbIjnCHn2y Great reporting by @missyran on the structural challenges facing defense modernization. In a competition, making decisions fast is crucial to success. The U.S. military must force the People's Liberation Army to react to our decisions - not the other way around. https://t.co/6YD7BecvdY Sadly, Sec. Becerra was recently confirmed to lead HHS. His history of advocating against pro-life policies, trying to force nuns to provide access to birth control &amp; pushing for the expansion of ‚Äúabortions by mail‚Äù during the pandemic, gravely concerns me in our fight for life. The truth is, the Democratic Party is steadily moving in this radical direction‚Äî we‚Äôve seen this progression for some time. However, you don‚Äôt need any further proof than the Biden admin. Just look at the policies &amp; leaders they're promoting. 

Read more: https://t.co/dSRf4Vs5q2 We say we support equality in the U.S., yet countless babies‚Äô lives have been stolen due to their chromosome count. I'm astonished that Dems can object to this commonsense bill and that they reject protecting the most vulnerable among us.

We salute him and all our @CapitolPolice ‚Äì today and every day. https://t.co/sU9UAi7TaZ It appears the administration is working to return to the deeply flawed 2015 Iran deal. As a reminder: Congress reject this deal on a bipartisan basis in 2015. If you repeat history next week, we will work to reject it once again. My full statement ‚Üì https://t.co/kztQ0iIPKg I‚Äôm grateful for the quick response of @CapitolPolice today and urge everyone to join me in praying for the officers injured and their families. I look forward to a full briefing as soon as possible. https://t.co/RYjOc5QaBU I couldn‚Äôt believe the words I was hearing and the radical agenda being exposed before our very eyes. I continued to push back in our debate: 70% of Americans oppose aborting a child on the basis of Down syndrome. 

Watch our full exchange. ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/IpgMs4MDdh On Feb. 3, I tried to provide an opportunity for the Dem-led Senate to pass my bill. I will never forget that day as I stood in shock listening to Dems object, calling it, ‚Äúa pretexual &amp; ideological extreme step... &amp; has nothing to do with protecting people with Down syndrome.‚Äù Great to hear that Altus, Okla., has been chosen as a Great American Defense Community. Oklahoma‚Äôs military bases play a crucial role in our nation‚Äôs readiness &amp; @97AMW‚Äôs role in maintaining the C-17, KC-135 &amp;  KC-46 continues to exceed expectations. 
https://t.co/ZT65FzookL To take away a child‚Äôs life because of his or her chromosome count is unthinkable and a blatant violation of anti-discrimination laws. The Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act would end that. 

More on this legislation. ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/KmYxJCZaQB In Jan., I led 21 of my colleagues in re-introducing a bill to help end the inhuman practice of discrimination by abortion. This bill would prevent doctors from performing an abortion on the basis of a belief that the unborn child has Down syndrome. 

‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/dSRf4Vs5q2 .@POTUS has talked the talk about pushing back on Chinese aggression, but the real marker of whether he‚Äôs serious about competing with China will be the proposed defense budget. A budget cut would send a terrible signal to Beijing ‚Äì &amp; our allies/partners. https://t.co/yEtJUFM2iK Just last week we advanced a large bipartisan water infrastructure proposal, and I am confident we can do the same for a highway reauthorization. I have successfully worked with past administrations to author bipartisan infrastructure plans that benefit all Americans. I'm committed to working with @POTUS and my colleagues in the Senate to do this right ‚Äì it can be done this year just as it has many times in the past. The Biden-Harris infrastructure proposal is a far cry from what @POTUS &amp; I discussed in our WH meeting. He is using transportation as an avenue to advance the far left‚Äôs agenda. The environmental left‚Äôs vision for the American economy will hurt rural OK &amp; eliminate oil/gas jobs. As we mark #NationalDoctorsDay this week, we take a moment to honor those who always sacrifice so much‚Äî especially during this pandemic. 

To our Oklahoma doctors and healthcare professionals: we are so thankful for you, we celebrate you and we couldn‚Äôt do this without you. https://t.co/hXJnooIkZE As prenatal screenings increase in availability and accessibility, more women have the ability to learn whether or not their baby has Down syndrome prior to birth. Sadly, many of these lives are aborted following a diagnosis.

My @BartlesvilleEE op-ed:

https://t.co/dSRf4Vs5q2 ICYMI: Recently, we marked World Down Syndrome Day and celebrated a community vibrant with life. With this, I want to bring to light a prominent problem in America.

https://t.co/dSRf4Vs5q2 General Milley is spot-on: ‚ÄùNuclear deterrence, strategic deterrence...has been effective in preventing great power war for 7 decades, since the end of World War II. And until, unless we have something better come along, I think we need to update and modernize the one we have.‚Äù Read this article and it's easy to see: We must prioritize long-overdue investments in the nuclear triad. If we don‚Äôt, we risk permanently losing our most effective means for deterring existential military threats. https://t.co/t37oli0PHH With gratitude and respect, we commemorate this day each year as #VietnamWarVeteransDay. To those who served and to their families: We thank you for your service and sacrifice. https://t.co/OfxsvKmcQH Proud to join @SenatorDurbin in introducing bipartisan legislation to chart a new course in our U.S./ Africa relationship. This act will help create American jobs by increasing the number of U.S. exports to Africa while also countering China‚Äôs growing influence on the continent. Over the past four years, we developed true energy independence. America leads in natural gas production &amp; we ought to export more of our clean, affordable gas to more allies around the world. Great to introduce legislation w/ @SenTedCruz to do just that. https://t.co/4sNTE6G7pU Facts don‚Äôt lie ‚Äì the border is in a crisis.

Read my recent op-ed that sheds light on how we got here and what we need to do next. 
https://t.co/6CqlGUObIg The only criticism I have of the American Petroleum Institute is that this won't cost them anything -- this tax will just be passed onto the public¬†where it will hurt struggling families the most. ... for families to heat/cool their homes &amp;fill up their tank at the pump. In the coming wks, I will push for a true accounting of how a carbon tax will hurt American families, especially low income families who are still struggling from the pandemic economy. A carbon tax is too costly for American families. We know what will happen. The price of milk will increase. Same with the price of bread, beef and other family staples. Energy costs will go up and it will be more expensive... At this week‚Äôs @SmallBizCmte hearing, I questioned @SBAgov officials on their COVID-19 relief programs &amp; issues currently facing Oklahoma small businesses. Great to receive some answers regarding PPP loans &amp; hear SBA‚Äôs next steps. https://t.co/nSxlkBWbIX Last week, @Google announced its plans to invest over $7B in offices &amp; data centers across the nation and create at least 10,000 new full-time Google jobs in 2021.

I applaud the ongoing efforts to secure access to low-cost energy for the base and look forward to continuing to work with them. It‚Äôs always a pleasure to speak with the McAlester Chamber of Commerce and hear about the great work being done at McAlester Army Ammunition Plant‚Äî an instillation essential in supporting the ammunition abilities and strategic readiness for our entire military. https://t.co/ler7s6GxWb On March 25, we honor 3,500+ brave service members who have earned the Medal of Honor ‚Äî the nation‚Äôs highest military honor ‚Äî including Army Master Sgt. Matthew Williams, who joined me to speak to Oklahomans. Our nation is grateful for your extraordinary service and sacrifice. https://t.co/qYnGSsa69F We can all agree, some countries south of the border are in crisis. Their citizens are leaving for a reason. But all immigrants must go through the legal channels‚Äîwe cannot allow anyone to cut the line. If Dems truly believe no repercussions will come from that‚Äîthey're mistaken. https://t.co/tgXFSGJ5US After seeing the comparison of border apprehension numbers from this year to last year, it makes no sense why Dems would blame this crisis on anyone but themselves. Biden froze funds for building the wall, he ended the ‚ÄúRemain in Mexico‚Äù asylum policy, &amp; called for mass amnesty. https://t.co/tgXFSGruwi We‚Äôve had a 173% increase in border apprehensions compared with one year ago. This past February‚Äôs apprehensions were highest total for February in 14 years. Numbers don‚Äôt lie and the common thread is Democratic policies. https://t.co/tgXFSGruwi It‚Äôs obvious to just about everyone outside Washington that the situation on our southern border is a crisis. Could anyone really believe it isn‚Äôt a crisis? 

Sadly, the answer is yes. And today, Senate Democrats proved that. https://t.co/tgXFSGJ5US This is not a position we take lightly, but we urge our Senate colleagues to reject this nomination when it comes to the floor. We‚Äôve each had a chance to hear from Dr. Kahl ‚Äì whether one on one, at his nomination hearing or both ‚Äì and we all agree that he has neither the disposition nor judgment to serve in this critical position at this critical time. Today, I, along with all of my fellow @SASCGOP members, voted to reject the nomination of Dr. Colin Kahl to serve as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy ‚Äì the number-three civilian position across the entire Pentagon. I‚Äôm proud to join @SenRubioPress in this resolution condemning the Chinese government for their ongoing crackdown on Hong Kong‚Äôs autonomy. We cannot allow the CCP to continue risking the lives and liberty of countless residents of Hong Kong. https://t.co/l56CUi79UJ In 1997, Hong Kongers were promised they could keep their autonomy, democratic gov. and capitalist economy for 50 years. Now, the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing is blatantly violating that agreement by imposing a heavy-handed communist rule. We must hold the CCP accountable. .@POTUS ‚Äì I‚Äôm glad you agree with me that China is our top pacing threat. Now, we need to see action to back up those words. The best thing we can do to deter Chinese aggression is give our military a strong defense budget. https://t.co/BgCfIXgAQu @POTUS made excellent selections with @SecDef and @DepSecDef, and I urge him to send us nominees who can garner the same bipartisan support as they did. This position demands bipartisanship, even temperament and good policy judgment ‚Äî characteristics I don‚Äôt believe Dr. Kahl has demonstrated. This is the number-three position at the @DeptofDefense ‚Äî and the policy role is currently even more important because the United States is facing more threats than ever before. I appreciate Dr. Colin Kahl‚Äôs commitment to public service, but I cannot support his nomination to serve as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. I discussed this with Admiral Aquilino, who has been nominated to serve as @INDOPACOM commander, at a #SASC hearing today. He agrees ‚Äì we need the F-35, and we need forces positioned in the region to respond quickly. https://t.co/8uHJ9U1X3q What we do or don‚Äôt do to deter China in the military domain will determine the success of our diplomatic and economic efforts as well.
¬†
That‚Äôs why we need the right investment, equipment (like the F-35), and posture in the Indo-Pacific ‚Äì to send a clear message to China. Proud to stand w/ @RepAshleyHinson to send a strong message to @SpeakerPelosi. This is hypocritical, not to mention an obscene overreach to overturn a state-certified election. Wanting to increase the Dem majority in the House isn‚Äôt grounds for overturning the will of the people. https://t.co/RAKlVPH2SO Why else would Biden shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline, which eliminated 10,000 union jobs, push a minimum wage increase that would cost 1.4M jobs and advocate for radical changes to labor law that would overturn states‚Äô right-to-work laws and harm independent contractors? Tonight, I opposed the confirmation of Marty Walsh to be Secretary of @USDOL. 

We need a secretary who will be for all labor, not just big labor. The Biden-Harris administration is clear‚Äîthey want him in the cabinet to work for big union bosses and not union workers. Faith-based providers across the nation are finding their adoptive services endangered because of their religious beliefs, which in turn means fewer loving homes for children. Proud to join @SenatorTimScott's bill to empower &amp; protect these providers. https://t.co/Kty0yD3P62 .@US_EDA is awarding a $1.25M CARES Act Recovery Assistance grant to Fairview to help recover from the pandemic and support rural health care in Northwest Oklahoma by expanding the outpatient therapy department of Fairview Regional Medical Center. https://t.co/L2bHw91Dgj Proud to join @SenThomTillis in reintroducing this act to punish violent criminals who intentionally target officers. I promise to continue to fight for the safety of those in Oklahoma &amp; across the nation who put their lives on the line to protect us. https://t.co/gH557Ny7YW That's why I joined @SenToddYoung in cosponsoring the DRIVE-Safe Act to address the truck driver shortage across industries such as oil &amp; gas, agriculture &amp; defense that drive Oklahoma‚Äôs economic growth, while improving safety and giving career opportunities to younger Americans. Oklahoma is rightfully recognized as one of the nation‚Äôs leading transportation hubs with 11,000 trucking companies and over 27,000 truck drivers using over 12,000 miles of highways to access and fully utilize our three inland ports and nearly 4,000 miles of rail. Clean drinking water and reliable water infrastructure is not only needed, it‚Äôs essential‚Äîespecially during extreme weather. 

It was great to introduce and hear @OklahomaDEQ's Shellie Chard represent our state and share her thoughts and expertise with the EPW committee. https://t.co/TdRWvXRP7k China continues to block Taiwan from obtaining observer status at @WHO, despite Taiwan being a strong, reliable &amp; dedicated public health partner to the U.S. &amp; international community. @SenatorMenendez &amp; I agree, Taiwan‚Äôs observer status must be restored. https://t.co/rbJI8yPtNP Continuing to ignore these actions as if they can be separated from what we do in our trading relationship is dangerously misguided. 

To combat this @SenTomCotton, @SenRickScott &amp;I introduced the China Trade Relations Act to end China‚Äôs permanent preferential trade relationship. I said it 20yrs ago and I will say it again: we can't allow the pursuit of trade to blind us to certain realities about China's Communist regime. They've violated far too many international agreements &amp; are known globally for their brutal repression &amp; disregard for human rights. As we continue the battle for life, I want to assure all Oklahomans and all those who believe in the sanctity of life that I will continue to do everything in my power to fight for our shared beliefs in Congress. I will not be deterred. https://t.co/VnDAV5ODZI It is the duty and responsibility of our president to nominate qualified individuals to lead our federal agencies. Sadly, that is not the case with this nominee. He is unfit to be Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra has an appalling track-record: vehemently advocating against pro-life policies in Congress, attempting to force nuns to provide access to birth control and abortion-inducing drugs and pushing for the expansion of access to ‚Äòabortions by mail‚Äô during the pandemic. Today, we will vote on confirmation of Xavier Becerra to be Sec. of HHS. 

Becerra is the wrong choice. His appalling track-record against the sanctity of life, multiple violations of the First Amendment &amp; radical polices prove that. 

See for yourself. ‚¨áÔ∏è
https://t.co/uGa7e9tsN9 The important work we see at @71FTW to keep our Oklahoma military families and communities safe, especially during a global pandemic, is appreciated. Thank you, @shopmyexchange for continuing to carry out your mission to serve and protect our OK military bases during #COVID19. https://t.co/3I0X6p5zcz This is a humanitarian &amp; national security crisis ‚Äî which is why I joined @SenCapito &amp; 39 of my Senate colleagues in sending a letter to @USGAO highlighting Biden's blatant violation of the Impoundment Control Act and infringement on Congress‚Äô constitutional power of the purse. And due to the administration‚Äôs actions, we are now facing an increasingly dangerous situation on our border. 

Our border agents are overwhelmed and Biden‚Äôs policies are encouraging illegal immigration ‚Äì plain and simple. In one of his first acts as president, Biden suspended border wall construction and ordered a freeze of these congressionally directed funds. I believe this action is unlawful. During the Trump admin, Congress directed funds to address the national security threat on our southern border by building a wall &amp; improving existing barriers. Due to this, illegal immigration began to dramatically drop‚Äîin some areas close to a 90% reduction‚Äîbecause walls work. ‚óºÔ∏è Over 100,000 migrant encounters in February.
 
‚óºÔ∏è Encounters in FY21 to date is 97% higher than FY20. 
 
‚óºÔ∏è Migrant children in custody has tripled in the past two weeks. 
 
This is a direct product of Biden‚Äôs bad policy‚Äîand according to him, not considered a crisis. https://t.co/U9bW9EkM3S We‚Äôve got a crisis at the border now, and two of our top military leaders confirmed today that if we want to address this problem, we‚Äôve got to start with enforcing our laws.

There is no doubt her priorities will harm Oklahoma‚Äôs energy economy &amp; our rural communities. I cannot support Deb Haaland‚Äôs nomination to be Secretary of the Interior. While I greatly respect and appreciate the significance that she will be the first Native American cabinet secretary, her radical, anti-fossil fuels background is extremely concerning for all Oklahomans.

üëé$1.5M on a bridge in NY  
But, we successfully made them strike those. Despite the massive, $1.9T price tag for this legislation that claims to be pandemic relief, almost none of it would go to address the pandemic. Just 1% would go to coronavirus vaccines. Only 5% would focus on pandemic public health. 

My recent op-ed.‚¨áÔ∏è
https://t.co/PhFf3R2EVC The future of a secure and open @uscapitol - the People‚Äôs House - lies with internal reform, creative thinking, and improvements made by the Capitol Police, in conjunction with other federal and local civilian law enforcement agencies. From the intelligence we‚Äôve seen, there‚Äôs no good reason to keep all the fencing and military personnel at the @uscapitol.
¬†
@SenRobPortman, @marcorubio, @RoyBlunt, @SenShelby and I wrote to the Capitol Police to ask for further justification for the current security posture. https://t.co/tiUTwVsDBL The other $122 billion would go out between 2022 and 2028. Clearly, Democrats‚Äô ‚Äúurgent relief‚Äù is not intended to help kids go back to school; instead, they are using the pandemic as an excuse to fund their liberal agenda in schools across the nation for the next seven years. Despite claiming ‚Äúemergency‚Äù relief, much of the money designated to schools wouldn‚Äôt be spent for years. According to @USCBO, the Dems‚Äô bill would distribute only $6.4B to K-12 schools this fiscal year‚Äîthat‚Äôs on top of the $68B we provided last year. ‚¨áÔ∏è 

https://t.co/PhFf3R2EVC Saddened to hear that a @USNationalGuard member supporting the Capitol security mission passed away following a medical emergency. Kay and I are praying for his loved ones. We will remember and honor his service to our nation.
https://t.co/RMVT6HUHbf I was a product of the draft, and it changed my life for the better. So I really appreciated the chance to hear from members of @Inspire2serveUS at today‚Äôs @SASCGOP hearing about how we can educate people about what it means to be an American citizen. https://t.co/0RoKI1PReD Regan will now be tasked with revisiting and, worse, possibly reviving, many of these failed Obama-era policies. Unfortunately, with the confirmation of Secretary Regan today, I fear we are on a path to reverse the great progress we have made in the past four years. I have great respect for Secretary Regan, but I cannot in good conscience vote to confirm him to lead the @EPA. The Obama-era EPA implemented bad policies that cost Oklahomans jobs and needlessly raised costs on families and businesses with a number of burdensome regulations. The Biden team keeps moving the metrics for school reopening based on national labor unions. Kids‚Äô presence in schools is not only an investment in our nation‚Äôs future, but it is also necessary so we can fully reopen the economy. 

My full thoughts below. https://t.co/PhFf3R2EVC Dems‚Äô legislation also throws money at big city schools, without pushing them to reopen. Dr. Fauci said it himself on MSNBC: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs less likely for a child to get infected in the school setting than if they were just in the community.‚Äù 

More on this. ‚¨áÔ∏è  
https://t.co/PhFf3R2EVC It‚Äôs right to want higher wages, but the progressive proposal would cost low-income Oklahomans their jobs ‚Äî and we can‚Äôt afford that. 

Read my full thoughts in my recent op-ed below. ‚¨áÔ∏èhttps://t.co/PhFf3R2EVC Instead of focusing on helping small businesses &amp; responsibly reopening the economy, progressives tried to push a min. wage hike. According to the CBO, a $15 min. wage hike would kill 1.4M American jobs‚Äî disproportionately affecting young, less educated people &amp; small businesses. Dems, under the direction of the Biden admin, rammed a $1.9T bill through Congress that spends hundreds of billions of dollars on untargeted ""relief"" and advances policies that have nothing to do with COVID recovery. 

More on the implications of this.‚¨áÔ∏è
https://t.co/PhFf3R2EVC There is bipartisan support for a targeted coronavirus bill that prioritizes relief for small businesses, reopening schools and public health, but unfortunately, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi have other ideas. 

Read my recent op-ed for more.‚¨áÔ∏è
https://t.co/PhFf3R2EVC We‚Äôre leading the way in Oklahoma. @GovStitt has kept our state open for business, jobs are being created &amp; new businesses are being recruited to move here. More than 1M vaccines have been administered‚Äî making OK a top 10 state for vaccine administration. 
https://t.co/ExhfgAJIuc Oklahoma families are clear in what they want to see: the nation‚Äôs economy reopened, children back in schools and public health prioritized ‚Äî making sure more and more people have access to the vaccine. 

Read my full thoughts below. https://t.co/PhFf3R2EVC Vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna were developed &amp; approved in under a year‚Äî a modern miracle. Just recently, the FDA approved J&amp;J vaccine. 
 
Though, we're not across the finish line yet, Okies are clear in what they want. 

Read my recent op-ed for more: https://t.co/PhFf3R2EVC In response to the #COVID19 pandemic, Congress enacted the largest relief package in history: $4 trillion over five laws passed with bipartisan support. The economy is bouncing back. The GDP is projected to return to its prepandemic level by the middle of 2021. We need to come together to prioritize relief for small businesses, reopening schools and addressing public health needs. I am sad to see that is not the case with this legislation. Instead of focusing on bringing relief to Oklahomans and responsibly reopening the economy, the Democrats have been playing partisan politics to get their liberal wish list done, including the bailout of blue states‚Äô unbalanced budgets with our hard-earned tax dollars. Today, I voted against Dems‚Äô $1.9T bill that claims to bring immediate COVID relief to Americans, but fails to address the needs of rural Oklahomans and recklessly funds liberal priorities that are unrelated to the pandemic‚Äîmuch of it designated to be spent years from now. The intent of a relief bill should be to save lives‚Äînot kill them‚Äîyet that‚Äôs exactly what Dems are doing by providing unrestrained funding for Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry in this reckless spending bill. Sad and disappointing. In their misguided relief package, Dems have left out important prolife protections that are regularly included in spending bills. My full statement on the Capitol Police request for continued National Guard presence at the Capitol Complex ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/lnhkGh3uS6 I look forward to working with law enforcement agencies and my colleagues to improve Capitol security and get our Guardsmen back home to their families. Keeping the Capitol Complex safe ‚Äî and open to the public, as it has been forever ‚Äî is a federal civilian law enforcement responsibility. This is not the job or mission of the National Guard ‚Äî and the image this would paint on the world stage is concerning. I‚Äôm outraged that U.S. Capitol Police have requested to keep the nearly 5,000 National Guardsmen at the Capitol Complex for another two months without presenting clear and specific information. Just a reminder that only 1% of funds in the Dems‚Äô relief bill are for COVID vaccines‚Äîand just 5% are focused on pandemic public health. Instead of focusing on overcoming the virus or supporting individuals who are impacted by it, this bill advances &amp; funds a Democrat wish list. Happy birthday to my good friend, colleague and fellow Okie, @SenatorLankford! https://t.co/yciF2pqUZm This should expose the truth behind this package created by Democrats. It's chock-full with untargeted ‚Äòrelief‚Äô working to advance policies that have nothing to do with COVID recovery. 

https://t.co/k5jKPGObpm The Democrat legislation that passed the House included $140 million for transit in Silicon Valley and $1.5 million on a bridge in New York. I was glad to hear Dr. Kahl, @POTUS‚Äôs nominee to be Under Secretary of @DeptofDefense for Policy, supports keeping the U.S. embassy in Israel in Jerusalem ‚Äì but I remain concerned he wants to lift sanctions on Iran when the regime is acting as bad as ever. https://t.co/DfALSBPFCL I‚Äôm used to disagreeing w/ senior officials, but what concerns me with Dr. Kahl's nomination is that hyper-partisanship - especially in regards to our national security - is inappropriate, for the position of Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. https://t.co/5YHBxjr7Qh Honoring all our Navy reservists, past and present, today -  ready now, anytime, anywhere for 106 years. Happy birthday, @navy_reserve! https://t.co/xltMzfDBnG With all the threats facing our nation today, our military has to focus on the greatest challenges, like China &amp; Russia. Leave climate change to the other Executive Branch departments, and let our service members focus on defending this nation. https://t.co/8uT40Dav1R I‚Äôm encouraged by this significant step that @AbiyAhmedAli took today to promote access to the Tigray region, especially for international relief organizations. 

Read more: https://t.co/dj5vpatAST https://t.co/sLQAxzYiSs I completely agree with @GenCQBrownJr. He‚Äôs saying what all our top military leaders have told @SASCGOP: Nuclear modernization must be one of our top national security priorities. https://t.co/lYW4vKiciB I‚Äôve used the 2018 National Defense Strategy as my road map for @SASCGOP to make sure we're giving our military the resources it needs to defend this nation.
¬†
With so much at stake, we've got to get it right.
¬†
https://t.co/fVXTJjN522 At today‚Äôs @SASCGOP hearing, two top national security experts confirmed that the 2018 National Defense Strategy shouldn‚Äôt change. Strategic competition with revisionist powers like China &amp; Russia ‚Äì that‚Äôs still our top threat. https://t.co/R8P7cesMJS With Dems inspiring the routing of these funds, we will most likely see schools in big cities like NYC &amp; LA receive priority over rural schools &amp; communities, like those in Okla. This spending is inappropriate, irresponsible &amp; biased and I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Last year, Congress appropriated $68B for K-12 schools. Of those funds, only $5B has been spent. Before ramming a partisan, 2 trillion dollar spending package through Congress, Dems should ensure our existing resources are spent wisely and effectively. The Biden admin and Democrats‚Äô relief bill includes $128.6B for K-12 schools‚Äîan astronomical amount‚Äîbut only $6.4B is planned to be distributed through September of this year. These ‚Äúemergency‚Äù funds will not be fully spent until fiscal year 2028. Sad to learn undocumented and potentially many unvaccinated illegal immigrants flooding across our southern border during a global pandemic is not considered a crisis to the Biden Administration. 

https://t.co/fMEVZBshJC Tonight, I voted against Mr. Cardona‚Äôs nomination because he made it clear during his confirmation process that he will advance the Biden administration‚Äôs misguided agenda in our schools. As the husband of a retired school teacher, my focus for @usedgov is to make sure it has a leader who will put students ahead of all else‚Äîespecially big government spending to increase federal control, liberal teachers‚Äô unions and harmful policies that threaten religious liberty. Great to see @US_FDA officially authorize @JNJNews's single-dose #COVID19Vaccine on Saturday. Johnson &amp; Johnson has stated they can deliver 20M doses by the end of March and has promised the U.S. government 100M doses by the end of June. 

Another step forward in the fight. https://t.co/7DSp8zZZnQ Global nuclear threats have only gotten worse over the past few years. It‚Äôs na√Øve to believe that if we simply abandon our nuclear deterrent, others will follow. @RepMikeRogersAL &amp; I implore @POTUS to work w/ us to ensure our deterrent is safe &amp; effective. https://t.co/6OgFQhnuN9 Joined my colleagues @SenatorRisch, @senrobportman, @marcorubio &amp; @SenToomey in a letter to @POTUS urging him not to rejoin the failed JCPOA and instead work with Congress on a more comprehensive and permanent deal. https://t.co/x2JeyhxxCu Proud to join @SenRubioPress and my Senate colleagues in re-introducing the Traditional Cigar Manufacturing and Small Business Jobs Preservation Act which seeks to protect small biz by exempting premium cigars from unnecessary and overly burdensome @US_FDA regulations and fees. ICYMI: The President has approved @GovStitt's request and granted Oklahoma a Major Disaster Declaration. This will release federal funds to help our Oklahoma citizens and communities recover from the unprecedented winter storms of the past weeks. This week, I wrote an op-ed for @WashTimes to speak on one of my favorite topics &amp; something I believe should be a bipartisan issue‚Äî infrastructure. Eager to get to work on infrastructure policy to further Oklahoma priorities. https://t.co/KOcktabuEx It‚Äôs shocking to me that one in three American adults is saying they definitely or probably won‚Äôt get the #covid19 vaccine. We‚Äôve heard it directly from the experts ‚Äì the vaccine is safe and effective, and I encourage all Americans to get it when it‚Äôs their time. https://t.co/LC8x8Sym2K Yesterday, @SASCGOP got an important update from senior officials on how the @DeptofDefense is helping respond to the #Covid19 pandemic ‚Äì including supporting vaccine distribution and addressing our overreliance on medical supplies from China. https://t.co/kG1VEKtDw0 My full statement on U.S. airstrikes in Syria targeting Iran-backed militias ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/LqVUsfsMzf The fact that Iran chose to escalate shortly after the administration declared its desire to resume negotiations with Tehran has not gone unnoticed. I hope the administration rethinks its current negotiating strategy with Iran and works with Congress on a bipartisan approach. Yesterday‚Äôs strikes were the correct, proportionate strategy to protect American lives, and I look forward to more information on the administration‚Äôs response to Iran‚Äôs aggression. Iranian proxies‚Äô recent attacks on American and Coalition personnel in Iraq are nothing new, but they must not be tolerated. I support the decision by @POTUS and @SecDef to continue the approach of the previous administration and hold them accountable. I‚Äôm concerned she will push Green New Deal-inspired policies that will harm Oklahoma‚Äôs economy, especially our oil and gas industry and rural communities. Today, I opposed her confirmation because of these concerns. I‚Äôm very concerned for the future of Oklahoma‚Äôs energy economy &amp; jobs under Jennifer Granholm. As Governor of Michigan, she advocated for auto industry bail outs and approved hundreds of millions of dollars in DOE grants to ‚Äògreen‚Äô startups that later went bankrupt. I‚Äôm grateful for all the work @DeptofDefense has done to respond to the pandemic from the very beginning, and their important role now in getting the #COVID19 vaccine distributed to our service members and around the country. https://t.co/EwkW14TAlo Yesterday, @PattyMurray, @JerryMoran and I led 39 of our colleagues in re-introducing the CONTRACT Act to ensure contract towers are fully-staffed with the most qualified, trained individuals available.

Here is a link https://t.co/Fx7j0Sd5wL https://t.co/4K4MLeXcbs If nearly 5,000 people per day isn‚Äôt a surge, not sure what would be @washingtonpost https://t.co/AY7os0XD3L This means someone is diminishing Americans‚Äô confidence in an important institution, the free press, but it isn‚Äôt me. The blame falls on @NYTimes and others who publish falsehoods anyone can spot, frittering away their remaining credibility. The answer is that @NYTimes is contemptuous of its readers. It smears the mainstream conservative website, @FDRLST, that published Waller‚Äôs account, as ‚Äúa far-right website,‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt think its own liberal readers will be open-minded enough to look up the piece. This raises the question: If @NYTimes isn‚Äôt honest about something people easily can look up, how can anyone trust it to be honest about anything else? I already told @ReidEpstein weeks ago that the eyewitness account I read didn‚Äôt attribute violence to ‚Äúfake Trump protesters,‚Äù and he could easily have read the piece. Either he chose not to, or he chose to deceive readers:
https://t.co/3XVsDuHIDw I said so as well in the hearing, saying it was a different group, disciplined and uniformed ‚Äî and not ‚Äúfake Trump protesters‚Äù ‚Äî who instigated violence. Read the essay and see that @NYTimes reported it untruthfully:
https://t.co/hp0T2qT8nv These are the ones he called ‚Äúfake Trump protesters.‚Äù But of them, he wrote: https://t.co/oVHh78boHy In it, @JMichaelWaller writes that he saw violence instigated by provocateurs ‚Äì as law enforcement later described to Congress. He also writes of ‚Äúyounger twentysomethings wearing new Trump or MAGA hats,‚Äù not fitting in and seeming to photograph ‚Äúas many faces as possible.‚Äù At a February hearing about Jan. 6, I read an eyewitness account from a security professional who was there, a man who taught political warfare to our nation‚Äôs military. It‚Äôs a compelling and worthwhile take on what one man saw:
https://t.co/hp0T2qT8nv .@NYTimes claims that I ‚Äúread into the record an account from a far-right website attributing the violence to ‚Äòagents-provocateurs‚Äô and ‚Äòfake Trump protesters.‚Äô‚Äù The last part is factually untrue, and the paper knows it. The @NYTimes‚Äô smear piece makes a central accusation: That I am ‚Äúhelping to diminish confidence in American institutions at a perilous moment.‚Äù As evidence, reporter @ReidEpstein repeats a falsehood.
https://t.co/cFKWfxa50l . @NYTimes expects readers will be ignorant of news that contradicts the approved narrative and reassures them that conservatives asking inconvenient questions can be ignored. It‚Äôs deception, not journalism. @NYTimes should be ashamed of squandering any credibility it still has. It isn‚Äôt just Greenland. @NYTimes and @ReidEpstein add, as proof of ‚Äúdisinformation,‚Äù that I ‚Äúsaid excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ‚Äòhelps the trees grow.‚Äô‚Äù Which it does, say scientists:
https://t.co/XreBcixpIn ‚Ä¶ It raises a bigger question: If @NYTimes and @ReidEpstein either can‚Äôt understand what a conservative says or resort to intentionally mischaracterizing it on a small matter like this, how can anyone trust them on larger matters? https://t.co/PkX093HqQ1 As for the supposed ‚Äúfalse history‚Äù that Epstein cites, the part where he‚Äôs either ignorant of or lying about what anyone can easily read ‚Ä¶
https://t.co/TAGOOeXmmZ What @NYTimes and @ReidEpstein seized on, of course, was the bit that I said was mere supposition on my part, the bit about Greenland‚Äôs name. The trivia. The part that wasn‚Äôt the point. Notice, I wasn‚Äôt saying Greenland had no ice, only that people once found it more hospitable for settlement. Which, again, is true:
https://t.co/HeeSllVf4R That is, I said Greenland once had a more temperate climate, so the Norse settled there for a while. Which happens to be true. Epstein should try reading up: 
https://t.co/LclR5OoNy5 In the interview, it was clear @ReidEpstein was building a narrative about ‚Äúdisinformation.‚Äù I called him on it, demanding he cite any. He backpedaled, saying I mentioned in 2010 how Greenland used to be green. Here‚Äôs the transcript of what I replied: https://t.co/STl5Hf7dby One of the weirdest parts of the @NYTimes‚Äô smear job on me was reporter @ReidEpstein claiming I ‚Äúoffered a false history of Greenland,‚Äù then quibbling about the origin of a name.  1/9
https://t.co/cFKWfxa50l D's vs. R's on taxes:

Republicans believe it‚Äôs your money and tax only enough to carry out functions of government.

Democrats believe it's all government‚Äôs money and they‚Äôre generous to allow you to keep any of the benefits of your hard earned work. https://t.co/DTWyEUAHKg Democrats want to nationalize elections so they can completely consolidate power for all time. They are trying to destroy conservatives and the Republican party completely, so we don't even compete in the arena of ideas. That is what is so dangerous about a biased media. #HR1 https://t.co/BWZcMLrCbI Judge Silberman's recent comments on the danger of media bias was spot on. In the NYT‚Äôs latest smear, they distort my recent comments and interview, twist them through a liberal prism and omit most of what I actually say.¬† Judge Silberman nailed it: https://t.co/pXY9GNvqqZ Always inspiring to visit a Joseph Project class and talk to successful alumni share their ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù to success.

I‚Äôll always condemn violence and rioting, regardless of who‚Äôs doing it. https://t.co/Xw3PFiABBI Peter Strzok, fired by the FBI for unprofessional conduct and a number of other violations, is not telling the truth ‚Äì AGAIN.

Senator @ChuckGrassley and I never received information from Derkach. https://t.co/V01TPTxlPF Leftists who want to memory hole last summer‚Äôs political violence lecture me that the 2020 protests were mostly peaceful. 570 leftist protests became riots. 25 dead. 700 officers injured.

https://t.co/3hzTLZLjfd Putin is getting bolder, and the West must respond with strength and resolve.¬†We must hold the regime responsible.¬†Additional sanctions are needed, and killing the #NordStream2 pipeline would be a good start. The Russian regime‚Äôs weekend round-up of political opponents and activists, including Vladimir Kara-Murza, is disgraceful.¬†America stands with the Russian people, condemns the harassment of the regime‚Äôs opponents &amp; calls for the release of political prisoners, including #Navalny. And they wonder why people don‚Äôt trust the mainstream media. This correction from @washingtonpost https://t.co/ih0pZruGTX Yesterday rioters in Portland attacked a courthouse &amp; assaulted an officer.

All riots should be condemned, regardless of location or cause. 

Waiting to hear condemnation from @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris https://t.co/gyerQPsTeq As long as covid exists, early treatment can save lives. By ignoring early treatment, government agencies failed us.¬†Now @joebiden begs us to put faith in government.¬†Why should we? Better question: Why did agencies, as we awaited a vaccine, not support frontline doctors exploring treatment with cheap, repurposed drugs? https://t.co/pu4tQplpml https://t.co/kDu9LGHrt5 Does @joebiden wants us to continue living in a state of fear? This pandemic could have been defeated months ago &amp; tens of thousands of lives saved if courageous frontline doctors and early treatment had not been censored and silenced as we awaited a vaccine. As I said in this interview, I could have gotten the vaccine in December but I decided to let others go before me who need it more than I do. That shouldn't be controversial. https://t.co/lrNDwo708J This is commonsense legislation @VP Harris supported when she served in the Senate. 

The GOOD Act simply asks federal agencies publish their regulatory guidance on the internet. 

Not sure why @POTUS revoked the executive order based on this idea.
https://t.co/91EOgmoI8M As @Journaltimes points out...""Relief is coming to Americans, but unfortunately also with more piled onto the national debt, which as of Monday totaled more than $28 trillion.

We're seeing a flood of progressive and radical legislation. https://t.co/wK8Jaszpv3 A caravan a day.

Those are the numbers we are seeing right now at the border.

We do not have the facilities to handle this.

This is the tip of the iceberg of a crisis caused by President Biden's policies. https://t.co/w8fHn8G0IT The tip of the iceberg near Yuma, AZ as immigrants begin to flood into the US responding to @JoeBiden‚Äôs open border, catch and release policy.  How many have COVID? https://t.co/8Cu3k88etZ I support helping people truly affected by the pandemic, but we should have targeted the unspent $1 trillion from previous bills first.¬†

The economy is already in a strong recovery, and this bill could spark harmful inflation. It was unneeded and unwise. .@SenSchumer attacked me because I wanted the Senate to take the time to hear what was in his $1.9 trillion boondoggle. Now we‚Äôre stalled 4 hours and counting because he can‚Äôt get his act together? I would like to thank the Senate clerks who read the $1.9 trillion bill yesterday. I know it was a big job and it‚Äôs unfortunate it took 11 hours. I finally got a hard copy of the bill about an hour into the reading and followed along the entire time. After listening to the entire 11 hours of the reading of this bill, it's clear this is not a COVID relief bill. 

It's amazing how much spending is for 2022-2028. 

This is just a Democrat wish list. https://t.co/SAYCsxd53c $1.9 trillion in additional debt is $5,800 per person. ¬†Added to the $4 trillion of earlier relief bills, its a debt burden of $18,000 per person. ¬†This relief isn‚Äôt free. Listening to the clerks read the Democrats' $1.9T bill, it‚Äôs amazing how many times you hear the year 2022, 2023 and beyond. I thought all this COVID relief spending was needed *now*. I just objected to skipping past the reading of the Democrats‚Äô 628-page bill that was just introduced minutes ago.

If they‚Äôre going to add nearly $2T to the national debt at least we should know what‚Äôs in the bill. Since more than 90% of this ""COVID relief"" bill is not even related to COVID, I think we need a full reading of the bill. 

Yes, it could take 10 hours but the American people deserve to know what's in it. 
https://t.co/QQDoCfkrHZ Another $1.9 trillion bill when we've already passed $4 trillion in COVID relief...AND we still haven't spent about $1 trillion of that!!

We've grown immune to these vast amounts of money.

Time for some perspective... https://t.co/Mp27nyTfU2 I'm going to make the Senate clerk read the Democrats‚Äô $1.9 trillion bill. All several hundred pages of it.

Then I‚Äôm going to offer amendments. Many amendments.

We need to highlight the abuse.

This is not a COVID relief bill.

It's a boondoggle for Democrats. Will be on @VickiMcKenna in 10 minutes talking about the Democrats‚Äô $1.9 trillion special interest giveaway. The American people need to know what‚Äôs really in it.

c. breached the Capitol building? 7) What groups were involved in planning or coordinating the breach of the Capitol?

a. How many members of each group were involved in the breach?
b. How many members of each group have been arrested or charged? 5) When did the U.S. Capitol Police begin to clear the Capitol building on January 6?

6) When did law enforcement reestablish the security perimeter at the Capitol? 4) How many gunshots were fired at the Capitol on January 6:

Here are my questions to  @SenGaryPeters @senrobportman @SenAmyKlobuchar @RoyBlunt 

This is what I will continue to investigate and ask these Senate leaders to examine... .@senrickscott asked witnesses if they knew of any threat that justified keeping National Guard at Capitol.  
No one knew of any. 
Time to thank the Guard for their service and send them home to their families. We certainly don‚Äôt need the Guard and concertina wire-topped fencing. An eyewitness account that I read excerpts from in today‚Äôs hearing provides a different perspective on what, why and how things got out of control at the Capitol on Jan. 6  @jmichaelwaller @fdrlst https://t.co/hp0T2qT8nv I couldn‚Äôt be more concerned about the radical Biden agenda. https://t.co/dnFKRiiqvD .@joebiden‚Äôs #Nordstream2 report is a big nothing burger. ¬†Looks like a return to the Obama policy of being gravely concerned or outraged at adversaries‚Äô malign actions but doing nothing in response. ¬†Actions speak louder than words. https://t.co/6BwFrk1A1a In this example, Honore calls the Capitol police ‚Äúcomplicit.""
https://t.co/aHidrhuOE3 Another example, this one attacking the free press: https://t.co/BpZyPEC59M For example: https://t.co/t166GdzfFm General Honor√© is an extreme partisan and should be the LAST person to head up an investigation of what happened at the Capitol on Jan 6th. .@ggreenwald is right. We all can and should condemn the Jan. 6 violence. But we must be honest and accurate about what happened. Attacking people like me who are simply asking legitimate questions does not serve our country or the truth.  https://t.co/2FIFamM9U8 https://t.co/g0DekTXvh4 Rush Limbaugh opened the door to conservative thought and political action for me and so many others who love freedom.

Hopefully, true healing can now begin. https://t.co/2FIFamM9U8 There is much to be investigated + many questions remain unanswered regarding Capitol Hill security on 1/6. What did Speaker Pelosi know about security preparations? Why have the @HouseSAA and @SenateSAA not responded to my letters? The public deserves full transparency. The 2nd part of my question: if the breach was foreseeable, why did the House Sergeant at Arms reportedly turn down a request to activate the National Guard, stating that he was not comfortable with the ""optics""? @siobhanehughes¬†https://t.co/jX52vzgDyp President‚Äôs lawyers blew the House Manager‚Äôs case out of the water. Legally eviscerated them. .@joebiden is considering travel restrictions in and out of Florida, but he just announced returning to catch and release on the southwest border - unbelievable. Biden‚Äôs plan will immediately let in 25,000 asylum-seekers who‚Äôd been waiting in Mexico as their cases were judged. 

Under Obama‚Äôs catch and release, only 4% of families whose claims were denied actually left. 

Why go back to that failure? What is @joebiden thinking? 

He just said he‚Äôll release asylum seekers all over the U.S. ‚Äì whether or not they have valid asylum claims. 

But don‚Äôt worry, he‚Äôs sure they‚Äôll leave years from now when most of their asylum cases are inevitably rejected. Appreciate Judge Brantmeier‚Äôs decision to force the @WDNR to follow the law regarding the management of our gray wolf population. https://t.co/8YgsafJ7kM Congress &amp; the Trump admin worked to expose China‚Äôs espionage &amp; influence ops in the US, including programs like Confucius Institutes. Now Biden has withdrawn a rule to increase transparency about these CCP front groups on campuses. Is this Biden‚Äôs idea of getting tough on China? Might not be a gold standard random controlled trial, but it‚Äôs a heck of a testimonial. ¬†Hopefully social media oligarchs will allow more Americans to hear this story of successful early treatment. https://t.co/R3yYDUxPgN .@MariaBartiromo Unless there are serious threats we‚Äôre not being told about, $483 million is a lot to spend to make the public believe 74 million Americans are insurrectionists who need to be deprogrammed and kept away from the People‚Äôs House. https://t.co/dEq44xy4Ir I joined 20 other senators asking @JoeBiden why he's against transparency in the federal government.

It‚Äôs obvious that people are being scapegoated. https://t.co/hssUCCOExo YouTube censors U.S. Senate testimony about early treatment using safe and cheap drugs by frontline #covid19 doctors but allows Chinese state media propaganda about #covid19.¬†https://t.co/wqkiUoL8M4 YouTube allows Chinese state media on their platform but not courageous doctors who save lives by treating #covid19 patients. Whose side is Google/YouTube on?"
"Kaine, Tim",timkaine,,Virginia,Virginia,Senator," We know that gun violence prevention legislation won't eliminate all violence‚Äîbut we take steps every day to  improve situations. Seatbelts improve vehicle safety. Raising the tobacco age reduces death to lung diseases. It's time to do the same with the scourge of gun violence. The legislation @MarkWarner and I introduced today takes commonsense steps that the Virginia General Assembly passed to keep people safer‚Äîsteps that are working. 

Universal background checks. One handgun purchase a month. Protections for domestic abuse victims. 

We need action. Virginia has been grappling with the scar tissue of gun violence and has taken meaningful steps to keep people safer. It's time to do the same in Congress‚Äîbecause we don't have to be bystanders to tragic violence. https://t.co/wFXywqoCdD Now is the time for police reform‚Äîincluding the Cost of Police Misconduct Act. It would:
-Let the public know about ALL allegations of police misconduct
-Track the price of lawsuit judgments and settlements

Shedding light on this darkness is a critical step in spurring reforms. Glad to be with my friend @chefjoseandres this evening‚Äîhis @WCKitchen is here at the Capitol to offer a small gesture of thanks to our Capitol Police officers and their families for everything they do. https://t.co/YlKrLVtgtW Senate barber Mario D‚ÄôAngelo celebrates 45 years on the job today. An important part of the Senate family. Great work Mario! https://t.co/Iju5iqXuzt Now, I look forward to working with the Administration on revising the authorization for the use of military force that has underpinned this long war. The challenges ahead won‚Äôt be solved with a continuing military presence but through the hard work of the Afghanistan government, Afghan people, and international community‚Äîlasting change can only come from the Afghans themselves, not U.S. forces. As we maintain humanitarian and diplomatic support for a partner nation, we should continue to work with the UN and regional partners towards a peace deal for the security and prosperity of the Afghan people‚Äîand to ensure Afghanistan does not again become a haven for terrorists. Development outcomes in Afghanistan, including access to education for women, increased life expectancy, and access to electricity, have significantly improved. Additionally, Osama bin Laden is dead, and Al-Qaeda degraded. I support the Biden Administration‚Äôs decision to withdraw the remaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan by September 11th. As we approach the 20th year of the war‚Äîthe longest in U.S. history‚Äîwe should acknowledge what we achieved and be realistic about the challenges that remain: Today I‚Äôm attending a ceremony honoring Officer Billy Evans, a loving dad and VA resident who was killed protecting our Capitol.¬†

This year has brought incredible trauma on our Capitol Police heroes‚Äîwe must do more to support them as they continue to put their lives on the line. For those who question the need to proclaim Black Lives Matter, the killing of Daunte Wright provides the answer, yet again: Because they continue to be treated as if they don‚Äôt.

Police reforms are needed‚Äînow‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just the start. Ramadan Kareem! Wishing the Muslim community in Virginia and across the world a blessed beginning to the holy month of Ramadan. This case shows why we must pass a federal police reform bill and reform immunity doctrines that shield misconduct. It‚Äôs disgraceful and unacceptable‚Äîin Virginia or anywhere else. https://t.co/pXbPZr0sbZ Honored to thank our National Guard members in person today. They‚Äôve given us COVID tests.

My heart is with the family and loved ones of the @CapitolPolice officer who has died. 

We are reminded again today of the incredible bravery of those who protect us, and I am so grateful for their service. I am praying for the second officer as we await more information. I've long said that Virginia is made infinitely richer by all the new American communities who call the Commonwealth home‚Äîwe're stronger and more innovative because of our diversity, and it's important to recognize and appreciate that. Thank you to all who shared tonight! Great discussion tonight with the Hampton Roads Asian American Alliance and my friend @BobbyScott‚Äîit's so important to speak out against hate and bigotry facing the AAPI community, but also to celebrate and lift up the way our diverse AAPI communities in Virginia make us better. https://t.co/IpBva42wuV In a year that @HRC has classified a record year for anti-transgender legislation, it's more important than ever for us to affirm our commitment to the transgender community and celebrate #TransDayOfVisibility.

I feel sick at the news of yet another senseless mass shooting‚Äîin a community already scarred by the scourge of gun violence. My heart is with Virginia Beach today.

We cannot stand by as more families lose loved ones. The time for Congress to act on gun violence is NOW. Everyone complete this sentence‚ÄîI will start:

I wouldn‚Äôt have made it through pandemic without... Jamel AKA Jamal. Great to spend this beautiful Friday in VA talking with constituents. Started the day in Leesburg for a roundtable with women-owned business leaders‚Äîwe know this pandemic has pushed women out of the workforce disproportionately. Glad to listen and talk with these experts. https://t.co/xAJDv4XOHz A hardworking immigrant grandfather killed in an act of senseless violence by two children. Could not be more tragic. Virginia mourns with the Anwar family. https://t.co/YcEybcmjHB So glad to see Strong Women recognized in my hometown.¬†And I admit partiality to one in particular... https://t.co/hFiFpulHkW The American public is sick of Congress acting like they‚Äôre a bystander. 

When evil happens in the world, too often it's because too many are standing by and letting it. Congress has got to quit acting like a bystander‚Äîespecially on the critical issue of gun violence. https://t.co/5yZbhEBDYV I‚Äôm proud to see Virginia abolish this brutal and racist institution. Today, Virginia gives us hope that work done for justice is not in vain, and that progress is possible for all.

I will continue to push legislation in the Senate to end the death penalty at the federal level. https://t.co/k5j04jWPsk More than 80 days into 2021, #EqualPayDay is a stark reminder that we must do more to secure fair pay‚Äîespecially as we see the COVID-induced recession disproportionately pushing women, and particularly women of color, out of the workforce.

We must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. Just as the families affected by these horrible gun violence tragedies come from all political parties, so must the leaders who work to prevent them. We don‚Äôt have to accept this. We can change it. But we've got to put the safety of the American public over our politics‚Äîand soon. Why haven't we been able to pass reforms like this before? Preventing gun violence sadly has been a partisan issue, and it's been difficult to get Republican votes. But these are not crimes that respect anybody‚Äôs politics‚Äîthe victims are from red states and blue states alike. It includes measures to make background checks universal, prevent access by minors, limit handgun purchases, promote responsible gun ownership, safeguard victims of domestic violence, and more. These are commonsense reforms that we know can make a difference. After the Virginia legislature took steps to combat the scourge of gun violence in 2020, @MarkWarner and I introduced the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence Act in the Senate, which was modeled after the slate of measures Virginia adopted. No single bill is going to prevent every single gun tragedy‚Äîbut we know we can reduce crimes like this with measures like comprehensive background checks. It‚Äôs imperative that leaders in Washington take meaningful action to keep the American public safe. The tragedies in Atlanta last week and Boulder yesterday‚Äîtwo of seven mass shootings that happened in the U.S. in a seven-day span‚Äîof course make us ask: Will we finally act to reduce gun violence in the United States? Here are some of my thoughts: 11 years after it was signed into law by @BarackObama, the Affordable Care Act continues to save lives. 

Health care is a human right, and through continuing to protect and build upon the ACA, we've got to reach universal coverage and make sure no one is left behind. My heart breaks for the families who are mourning in Boulder. For the lives taken too soon. It breaks for the seven children left behind by Officer Eric Talley. And it breaks for our country as we reckon with more senseless gun violence. Enough is enough. Virginia‚Äôs neighbors in D.C. deserve representation just like every other American.

Proud to co-sponsor #DCStatehood legislation in the Senate‚Äîit's far past time to recognize D.C. as our 51st state and grant hundreds of thousands of taxpaying Americans this fundamental right. https://t.co/pWate2SyUU Nowruz Mubarak to all those celebrating the new year in Virginia and all across the¬†world!

After Virginia's history-making vote to ratify the ERA last year‚Äîserving as the 38th and final state needed to reach the threshold‚Äîit's time for the Senate to follow the House's lead, eliminate this deadline, and enshrine equal rights in our Constitution. #ERANow! https://t.co/NfdLzEkMRK I am deeply disturbed by the rise in anti-Asian bigotry and violence we‚Äôre seeing across the country. I stand in solidarity with the AAPI community, and am committed to combating hate in all its forms. Follow organizations like @StopAAPIHate and @AAAJ_AAJC for more we can do. My heart breaks for the families of the 8 people tragically killed in Atlanta‚Äîincluding 6 Asian-American women. I‚Äôm sending my sincere condolences to all of their loved ones. We must do more to stamp out hate and prevent senseless violence. 7 of my 8 great-grandparents emigrated from Ireland.¬†The 8th was born in Ireland, moved to Scotland and then came to the US.¬†Immigrants share the same dreams.¬†Happy St. Patrick‚Äôs Day! The right to vote is at the heart of American democracy, and yet far too many are still denied that basic right. This is great news for Virginia and for all who support a free and fair democratic process! https://t.co/JdUfldsdcw UVA, Liberty, Norfolk State, VCU, and VaTech in Men‚Äôs 64.¬†Does any other state have 5 in?¬†Plus VCU women win A-10!

On this difficult day, my heart goes out to Breonna's family and all who loved her. We cannot stop fighting for justice‚Äîfor everyone who has been failed by a system infected with racism. Great to be with volunteers at the King George Family YMCA who have come together to support vaccine distribution. These folks are doing more than administering vaccines‚Äîthey‚Äôre giving people a boost of hope, too. Grateful for all our health care workers! https://t.co/MF5xps7kLf From coffee shops to spas to restaurants to music stores, so many of our strong local businesses have been grappling with the impacts of the pandemic. Great to talk with small business owners in Fredericksburg today along with Mayor Greenlaw about the relief coming their way. https://t.co/iJ5hjpO1PJ 50 days after @POTUS assumed office, daily COVID deaths are nearly cut in half and daily vaccinations have more than doubled. By signing the American Rescue Plan today, President Biden is leading us even further in the right direction. After a dark year, light is on the horizon. https://t.co/U05GK30OSH Whether you're in a red state, a blue state, an in-between state, no matter who you are or what you do‚Äîevery ZIP code in the United States, every family in the United States will soon see and feel the real, tangible impacts of the American Rescue Plan. The American Rescue Plan has a theme song. https://t.co/kW13DpKGw1 Just looked up from my desk and it‚Äôs March Madness.¬†Duke a 10th seed in ACC?¬†Xavier, Georgetown, Marquette, and Butler in bottom half of Big East?¬†Did COVID erase my bball memory?

But VCU, UVA, and VT lookin‚Äô good.¬† Guess I‚Äôm ok! -7 million Virginians benefitting from stimulus checks
-$6.9B to state and local governments in Virginia
-85,000 Virginian kids lifted above the poverty level
-250,000 adults with extended unemployment insurance
-$2B for Virginia schools

Today is a good day for the Commonwealth. A year ago tomorrow, I sent my Senate staff home for a ""trial run"" of remote work‚Äîmost still haven't come back in person.

A year ago Friday, @GovernorVA declared a state of emergency.

But after many dark days, today is a bright one. The American Rescue Plan is here to help. https://t.co/KiBmjkPv4f This is the right thing to do, and I applaud @POTUS for supporting Venezuelans in the US. We cannot force people to return to Venezuela in the midst of ongoing violence and a humanitarian crisis. https://t.co/5B1uq1SrJH The American Rescue Plan is one of the boldest pieces of legislation in modern history‚Äîits impact on poverty, and particularly child poverty, is going to change people's lives. https://t.co/KMvzTNzRp2 On #InternationalWomensDay and every day, it's up to all of us‚Äîespecially men‚Äîto speak up about women's equality, challenge gender assumptions and stereotypes, and honor women's accomplishments. Proud to celebrate #IWD2021 today and recommit to fighting for full equality. Glad to be with @rbrexperience today for #MobileSoulSunday‚Äîespecially knowing that our great restaurants will soon have needed support thanks to the American Rescue Plan. More than $28 billion for restaurants, prioritizing those owned by people of color, veterans, and women! https://t.co/1jp5Bv42Vw A sunrise after a long night‚Äîfor all of us. https://t.co/MKNE9WqNBA The past year has been dark, but with this much-needed relief and the acceleration of vaccinations, a brighter, healthier, more prosperous America is on the horizon. https://t.co/1DL18Axzrw 24 hours and 12 cups of coffee later‚Äîwe are pushing on and very close to getting $1.9 trillion in relief to the American people. The American Rescue Plan is packed with critical relief for families, workers, and businesses‚Äîfrom a national vaccination plan and support for schools to safely reopen, to extended unemployment insurance and direct aid in workers' pockets. I'll proudly vote YES on COVID relief. Let‚Äôs take a moment today during this reading to acknowledge all of the relief that this package will provide American families, workers, and businesses. Follow along at @SenateDems for highlights‚Äîthen let‚Äôs get this passed. https://t.co/I8NnUCMWpt While I preside over the Senate today, one of my GOP colleagues is insisting the entire COVID package be read aloud on the floor‚Äîan effort to delay relief. 

But I‚Äôm confident that Americans will enjoy hearing all the ways D‚Äôs are working with @POTUS to offer meaningful relief. The Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act is just one piece of the work we need to do to support our frontline workers throughout this pandemic‚Äîbut it's an absolutely critical piece. It's my hope that this bill will be included in our next COVID relief package. And not only will the impact of trauma be ongoing, but too often health care professionals face stigma in accessing treatment. It's important to change how our health care system approaches mental health and set up a more reliable infrastructure and culture for those workers. In my conversations with health workers, it's clear that this crisis is going to have a significant impact on their lives for a long time. Even as we start to see a light at the end of the tunnel, the healers who‚Äôve been caring for everyone else will continue to feel its effects. In April 2020 Dr. Lorna Breen, a physician from Charlottesville, Virginia, working on the frontlines of the pandemic in New York, died by suicide‚Äîbringing this issue to the forefront of our national attention.

The issue of keeping our healers healthy cannot be ignored. Today I'm reintroducing the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act‚Äîlegislation to reduce and prevent suicide, burnout, and mental health conditions among health care professionals.

This is so important‚Äînow more than ever before. I hope you'll read more about it: I call on Congress to promptly take up our bill to repeal these outdated and unnecessary war authorities, and for the Biden Administration to support it. It‚Äôs time to show the American people that the Article I and II branches can work together on issues as serious as war. Last week‚Äôs airstrikes in Syria show that the Executive Branch‚Äîregardless of party‚Äîwill continue to stretch its war powers. The 1991 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force serve no operational purpose, keep us on permanent war footing, and could allow future misuse. https://t.co/i9XMLD3qeH If we want to reduce police misconduct, we need true transparency first. That's why @RepDonBeyer and I are introducing the Cost of Police Misconduct Act today, which will give the public powerful information that will spur reform. https://t.co/gZen0YO6r2 Saturday morning‚Äîjudging the Virtual Spelling Bee at Maury Elementary School in Alexandria! https://t.co/IJNxmHBlpH Saudi Arabia also must immediately release wrongfully held peaceful activists‚Äîincluding Virginian Salah Al-Haidar‚Äîand stop using travel bans and assets freezes to stifle dissent and trap U.S. citizens and residents inside its borders. These egregious human rights abuses must end. I'm relieved this Administration did what the Trump Administration refused to do: publicly acknowledge that MBS was responsible for the horrific killing of Virginia resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia must be held accountable for this heinous crime. https://t.co/xyO2SrtnnW Christopher Marlowe, Levi Strauss, Buffalo Bill, Johnny Cash, Natalia Lafourcade, Corinne Bailey Rae + TK. A great day to be born. Being discriminated against for who you are‚Äîor who you love‚Äîis a burden on the soul that absolutely no one deserves. I'm so glad the House has passed the Equality Act and I'm deeply proud to be a cosponsor in the Senate. Today we're one step closer to ensuring equality for all. One year ago today. The Big Lie. https://t.co/AAMhtviBc7 Great news, and more important than ever for Congress to get COVID relief passed that will help speed up the vaccine rollout. 

There's a light at the end of the tunnel‚Äîbut we've got to keep up the masking and distancing while we push towards it. https://t.co/oWmIb916Hn If you can change it here, you can change it anywhere. https://t.co/VOkLVhXIBd A job well done by Virginia student Alex, who named the newly-landed Mars Rover! A reminder to us all to continue to persevere. https://t.co/Z0HkPkodwb Two ice storms back to back in VA. Stay safe‚Äîif you are without power, call Dominion at (866) DOM-HELP to report and follow safety tips from @VARedCross and @VDEM. https://t.co/Il1vudAD5H Good day for our country and our planet‚Äîgrateful that Sec. Blinken and @POTUS have made this a priority. https://t.co/K45o23Nfq2 A shocking story. US should be playing a leadership role in ensuring that entire countries are not shut out of vaccine deployment. https://t.co/QaXtoL0rql Proud to reintroduce my Medicare-X plan with @MichaelBennet. The past year has laid bare just how critical achieving universal health coverage is‚Äîand our plan to create a public option built on Medicare will help make coverage more accessible and more affordable. https://t.co/aN3dNAIPp8 Grateful for all the volunteers and the @VaNationalGuard who are supporting the administration of vaccines today at the Salem Civic Center. 

Mask up, get vaccinated when you‚Äôre eligible, and stay safe! https://t.co/krGe1WJ82w Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day!¬†I am an Earth Dog Pisces married to a Fire Rooster Aquarius.¬†Apparently, this is supposed to be a disaster.¬†But‚Äîkeeps getting better! I will vote to convict because seven people needlessly died and hundreds were injured by a former President‚Äôs egregious lies. 

So many risked all to protect us. 

The least we can do is protect them by voting to condemn and thus prevent behavior that should never be repeated. And make no mistake: The events of January 6th‚Äîseven dead, the first siege of our Capitol in over 200 years, the disruption of the peaceful transfer of power‚Äîare the direct result of that first acquittal. I will vote to convict President Trump in his second impeachment trial.
 
A year ago‚Äîupon the conclusion of President Trump‚Äôs first impeachment trial‚ÄîI said ‚ÄúUnchallenged evil spreads like a virus,‚Äù and that an acquittal would lead to worse behavior. Question for my Senate colleagues: Rioters shouted ‚Äúhang Mike Pence‚Äù and called him a traitor. Where did they get the idea that Pence did anything wrong? Trump saw Congress under siege as an opportunity to stop the peaceful transfer of power! And hours later, when Capitol police were still fighting for their lives, he had Giuliani call Tuberville to beg again. Most shocking revelation from trial thus far: Pence taken from chamber to protect his life at 2:13 pm. Trump sends tweet trashing Pence to millions, then calls Tuberville while Senate is under lockdown. He asks Tuberville for help to delay‚Äîor stop‚Äîcalling the election. Officer Eugene Goodman‚Äôs heroic actions on January 6th saved lives. I was proud to sponsor this resolution to award him the Congressional Gold Medal. I offer my deepest gratitude to Officer Goodman. https://t.co/YR3jIxcy2s I strongly support ending the death penalty‚Äîa policy that has been applied in a manifestly racist way throughout our history. I applaud our Virginia legislators for sending a powerful message around the country and world today, and am working to do the same at the federal level. https://t.co/VMhVvu9NnB This is why I am fighting so hard for the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act. https://t.co/X6ugh35mtX As @POTUS has said, we are not at risk of going too big with this package. When you look at this crisis‚Äîthe death rates, the shock to our economy, the mental health tolls‚Äîthe scale is staggering, and the impacts are going to be longterm. We can't go small, and we can't delay. The fact is, lifting up these stories and naming these people is not the best way to honor them. The way to honor them is through compassionate, prompt, and significant action to ease the suffering of Americans during unprecedented times. Today I spoke on the Senate floor about COVID. I shared stories from nurses whose experiences will break your heart. I talked about housing. And for the second time, I read the names of the people I know who have died‚Äînine as of this week. I don't want to do this a third time. My heart goes out to the family and loved ones of Officer Brian Sicknick today‚Äîhis death was a tragedy, and together we mourn this unnecessary loss of life. https://t.co/ZSfQp7GFYR I really care, don‚Äôt you? https://t.co/seWr5D3F7o And as we celebrate #BHM we also must acknowledge that we've got real work to do to reach our founding principle of equality and to change the systems that protect and promote injustice. On the first day of #BlackHistoryMonth I'm thinking of Virginians like Mildred Loving, Arthur Ashe, Barbara Johns, Maggie Walker, Doug Wilder. The contributions of Black Americans to our Commonwealth and country are invaluable, and this month is an opportunity to celebrate them. Happy birthday Anne! From Galway Kinnell who shared your birthday:

We will walk out together

Senate Dems are lucky to have @GaryPeters at the helm! https://t.co/pwy2ghGla7 For far too long, Virginia‚Äôs neighbors in D.C. have been denied their civil rights and subject to taxation without proper representation.

I'm very glad to join my colleagues @PattyMurray and @SenSanders today to introduce the Raise the Wage Act to give hardworking people a fair shot at economic mobility. One of the heroes of my youth.

These decisions are the first step in undoing the damage of the previous four years and moving into a fairer, healthier future. https://t.co/1o38XGWvKK My sincerest congratulations to my new colleagues, Senator Ossoff, Senator Padilla, and Senator Warnock. I'm so glad to have you here, and look forward to working with you as we build this country back better. Humbled that @ReverendWarnock asked me to present him in the Senate Chamber today as he is sworn in by Vice President Harris‚Äîin her first day presiding over the Senate. It's an honor to be with him in this historic moment. Welcome, Senator Warnock! Today, we begin a new chapter as President Biden and Vice President Harris restore compassion and competence to the White House. 

Our new Administration is committed to healing our country, and I‚Äôm thrilled to work with them to deliver the meaningful relief Americans¬†deserve. https://t.co/RkoGGc1Mxv I have a bizarre and useless skill‚ÄîI can say any word backwards. So imagine my anticipation for America‚Äôs first double palindromic inauguration: 1/20/21. Also 1/20/2021. A beautiful tribute tonight from our compassionate new President. I join Joe, Kamala, and so many across the country tonight in grieving and honoring those we've lost to COVID-19. I am sending my heartfelt prayers to everyone who has lost someone they love to this virus. https://t.co/d8Xx3AQQtJ Refreshing to welcome an Administration that will call out human rights violators rather than turning a blind eye. https://t.co/gMl3rTCHOG If 2020 demonstrated anything, it‚Äôs that the life mission of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is far from complete. As we look forward, we have to dedicate ourselves even more to the north star of equality that Dr. King died for‚Äîbut more importantly, that Dr. King lived for. #MLKDay I want to express my deep gratitude to all working hard to ensure a safe inauguration week in Washington‚Äîincluding @VaNationalGuard members. While the need is disheartening, their commitment to safety and service deserves our thanks. When a non-profit must file for bankruptcy, [complete this sentence].
https://t.co/tF2rJaxCN8 Amid an incredibly dark winter, I‚Äôm so looking forward to having compassion, character, and competence back in the White House‚Äîand to working with the Administration and my colleagues to help people across the country build back better. https://t.co/9TYdiIxdtk Encouraged to see the Biden-Harris Administration already unveiling plans to speed up vaccination efforts and deliver direct relief to those hit hardest‚Äîproviding a ladder for Americans to climb out of the economic, social, and public health hole they were pushed into. https://t.co/WLfh50fMfY 343 days ago I voted to convict President Trump, saying on the Senate floor that ""unchallenged evil spreads like a virus"" and that an acquittal would lead to worse conduct.

Here we are. 25th Amendment‚Äînow. https://t.co/Aer2rtH1nX Glad to see that the White House has now lowered the flag. Sunday, January 10th, 2021. Capitol flags at half mast. White House? Just a normal day.

I am heartbroken to learn of his death, and my condolences go out to his family and the rest of Capitol Police. https://t.co/fEO6RtjmyX Thoughts on January 6th, 2021. https://t.co/eqKFuFheBQ I'm sending my deepest condolences to the family of Virginian and Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who has tragically passed away in the line of duty. I will be praying for his loved ones. I'm profoundly grateful to all who put their lives on the line to protect others. No comment necessary. https://t.co/8JDcXgkhx0 America needs to help the Biden/Harris Administration repair the damage and exit a painful chapter, sadder but wiser, rebuilding a nation committed to eternal American values. Law enforcement officials should investigate and, if warranted, punish insurrectionists. That includes citizen Trump, who loses all immunity on January 20th. Congress must also dig into the awful lack of security yesterday‚Äîpraising those who performed heroically and holding accountable those who allowed the second attack on the Capitol in US history. The sun is up on a new day. But there must be accountability for yesterday:

The Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment against Trump. If he wants to challenge, Congress should vote him out.

Congress should inform Trump that he is not welcome at the inauguration. What took 34 minutes in 2017 took more than 14 hours in 2021‚Äîbecause, goaded by the President and abetted by some of my fellow Senators, right-wing insurrectionists stormed the Capitol in support of an effort to overturn the election results and install an unelected government. https://t.co/ydXA6zD3Wh In today's very early hours, we certified the Electoral College results, making official what we have known since November: that at noon on January 20th, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris will lead our nation to a healthier, fairer, more prosperous future. https://t.co/xQwSWqNjW5 But more importantly‚Äîas the body that acted together to guarantee Americans the right to vote‚Äîif we object, we will become the agent of one of the most massive disenfranchisements in the history of this country. The United States Senate cannot and must not allow that to happen. If we object to these electoral results, we‚Äôre saying to states: No matter how safe and secure your elections are, we‚Äôll gladly overturn them if we don't like the results. After John Lewis was savagely beaten on Bloody Sunday, the US Senate came together to pass the Voting Rights Act.

We should be coming together today‚Äîafter more violence‚Äîto affirm the votes cast in November. Instead we‚Äôre contemplating an unprecedented act of disenfranchisement. Tonight I spoke on the Senate floor about exactly what objecting to these electoral results means for our country: Not since the Burning of Washington by the British during the War of 1812 has the Capitol been attacked. The violence we saw today was an anti-American, anti-democratic assault on our nation. All must condemn it in the strongest of terms. My staff and I are safe right now‚Äîfollowing the instructions of Capitol Police and praying for the safety of Capitol workers, members of the press, and all here in Washington today. This violence must end now. To any of my Senate colleagues looking to overturn state electoral results and undermine our democracy today: I hope you‚Äôll take a look in the mirror and consider how you want to be remembered in our history books.

Don‚Äôt sell your soul to join a toddler in his tantrum. The American public is telling us loud and clear that we need bold action to get out of the disaster that was 2020. Trump's horrible mismanagement of the pandemic, economic devastation, racial injustice‚Äîthese challenges are crying out for solutions, and we've got to deliver. https://t.co/fWRHWK4FDq Congratulations to Senator-elect @ReverendWarnock! 

From the pulpit of the Ebenezer Baptist Church where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached, to the US Capitol as Georgia‚Äôs first African American Senator‚ÄîGeorgians and Americans are blessed to have Dr. Warnock as a leader. Yes, Donald Trump is flagrantly attempting to subvert the will of the people.

But whether a few spineless lemmings follow him off that cliff tomorrow or not, his temper tantrum is not going to make a difference.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will assume office in 15 days. HD-2 includes parts of Prince William County and Stafford County, and HD-90 includes parts of Norfolk and Virginia Beach. If you‚Äôre not sure whether you‚Äôre registered to vote in those districts, give the @vademocrats voter hotline a call at 844-4VA-VOTE. Virginians, if you‚Äôre registered in the 2nd or 90th districts, today is Election Day!

I look forward to celebrating Joe Biden's inauguration in 17 days. Trump is trying to overthrow our democracy. To my colleagues tempted to go along: Don‚Äôt let your ambition/fear dwarf your integrity!

Joe Biden will be sworn in as President on 1/20/21. Trump is a spoiled rich kid who's talking about our democracy like it's a real estate deal. News flash to the current President: It's not a negotiation, it's an election. The voters decided‚Äîand you lost. https://t.co/C1C59GZCnE Senators of both parties must stand up together on January 6th to overwhelmingly defeat the overthrow attempt and then repair the damage done to the Senate and nation. Your challenge is hypocritical‚Äîyou voted against impeachment, saying ‚Äúlet the people decide,‚Äù but are now attempting to void their decision. Your challenge is elitist‚Äîyou assert that your preference must be respected while state results and voter preferences must be ignored. Your challenge is discriminatory‚Äîyou are attempting a massive disenfranchisement of select voters in select states that voted for the Biden/Harris ticket. Your challenge is dangerous‚Äîyou are attempting to overthrow the government of the United States. To Senators attempting to overturn state electoral results in states that voted for Biden/Harris: Translation: ‚ÄúI am afraid of President Trump and his Q/MAGA protestors and hope that this stunt will make them like me.‚Äù   

This appeasement effort is weak and the wrong way to deal with a bully. https://t.co/Ez8bN1sn3V Glad my colleagues on both sides of the aisle stood by our servicemembers today. 

For 60 years in a row, the NDAA has provided necessary support for our troops and national security‚Äîand Congress will not allow President Trump to stand in the way of that support. https://t.co/0jhuvn8WQ7 Wishing everyone a peaceful start to the new year. It‚Äôs been a challenging time for all and heartbreaking for too many‚Äîmay this new year bring us hope. There is exactly one reason $2,000 stimulus checks aren't going to Americans: Mitch McConnell.

The work we‚Äôve done in the first 100 days was so critical to that effort. Now, we need to keep up the fight to beat this virus and start moving forward. In all, Arizona is expected to receive billions in federal support from the COVID relief package to get vaccines into Arizonans‚Äô arms, beat this virus, and put us on a path to economic recovery. Here‚Äôs what Arizona received in the latest package: https://t.co/dsC3vWZY9g I also advocated for the funding of drinking water and wastewater projects in rural and tribal communities. For example, members of The White Mountain Apache Tribe have been without safe, reliable drinking water for years because of unfinished projects. https://t.co/qB61sM7RZL Another provision I fought for in the COVID relief package was the creation of community navigator programs to help small businesses get the support they need ‚Äî including Spanish-speaking and rural businesses who didn't receive help the first time around. https://t.co/1nZWHjsZDY There were three provisions in the COVID relief package that I advocated for after receiving important feedback from my Arizona Advisory Groups. The first was direct funding for seniors facing food insecurity, isolation, and problems securing a vaccine. https://t.co/m0g2oc0MkC From day one, it‚Äôs been my top priority to secure direct relief for Arizona families, seniors, and small businesses. I‚Äôm proud to say that in my first 100 days in office, we passed two COVID relief bills doing just that. Here's what‚Äôs in the latest package: https://t.co/HbDnB7kzt1 Great news for Northern Arizona: UACJ Automotive Whitehall will open a new manufacturing plant in Flagstaff, creating hundreds of high-paying jobs for the region. This is exactly the kind of economic investment we need to get our economy back on track. https://t.co/w2CCdQ7hcU Congratulations to Dr. Jos√© Luis Cruz for his appointment as the next president of @NAU. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss how we can better prepare Arizona‚Äôs students as they move into our workforce. https://t.co/mtfZ3e8nbJ Sec. Haaland‚Äôs confirmation as the first Native American to lead @Interior is a historic moment for our country and an important one for AZ. I look forward to working with her to protect Arizona‚Äôs public lands, serve our tribal communities, and on other issues important to AZ. https://t.co/1fq13YdFsI Happy birthday to the @AmericanLegion, who has been serving veterans for 102 years now. Right now, they‚Äôre working tirelessly to make sure our veterans get the support they need in this pandemic, and I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for their work. In my next 100 days, I‚Äôm eager to continue working with my Republican and Democratic colleagues on beating this virus and jumpstarting Arizona‚Äôs economic recovery. As a Navy combat pilot and former NASA astronaut, it's an honor to continue serving our country in the U.S. Senate. I‚Äôm also proud to have the opportunity to continue Arizona's legacy of serving on @SASCDems. In my first 100 days, I toured both @LukeAFB and @DMAFB as well as the Douglas Port of Entry to learn more about what I can do to strengthen our national security. https://t.co/kBvCpfRzfy When I took this job, I promised to push past party politics to get the results Arizonans needed. That‚Äôs what I did when I introduced two pieces of bipartisan legislation ‚Äî one bill to support border businesses and the other to protect mental health and prevent substance abuse. https://t.co/Ljoocu7zgr My top priority has been securing the relief Arizonans need to fight the coronavirus and start the road to recovery. We‚Äôve passed two relief packages since I was sworn in, and I plan to continue fighting for the resources Arizona needs in my next 100 days.
https://t.co/7JamqB4ISQ Last week marked my first 100 days in office, and I‚Äôm proud of what we‚Äôve accomplished for Arizona families in that time. https://t.co/3cBGDA5Kqo Last month, I got the chance to take a helicopter aerial tour over the Rio Salado and Gila Rivers to learn more about Rio Reimagined projects and how they‚Äôll protect Arizona‚Äôs water resources while creating economic opportunities for the local community. https://t.co/Q1RjSM1CZ0 My first meeting as Senator was with Arizonans affected by COVID-19. Today, on my 100th day in office, we did it again. And while help is on the way, I'm going to continue doing the work necessary to move Arizona towards recovery.

December 3, 2020 // March 12, 2021 https://t.co/gy0zymM3mF Many Arizonans are battling mental health and substance abuse issues created by this pandemic, so I'm introducing a new bill with @SenCapito to ensure we learn from this moment and develop a national strategy to prevent it from happening in future crises. https://t.co/WvvkVqQT7W With¬†you,¬†@GabbyGiffords, there‚Äôs always adventure to be had, beauty to be seen, change to be made, and joy to be found.
https://t.co/kEkowVJuTV The courage and persistence of Tuskegee Airmen like Lt. Col. Ashby in the face of discrimination is what broke down barriers and ended segregation in the military. My condolences to his family and loved ones. https://t.co/1jCPGwxdjk Native American communities have been some of the hardest-hit in this pandemic. The COVID relief bill we passed will get tribal governments the resources needed to continue fighting the virus while building infrastructure ready to tackle future outbreaks. https://t.co/Ro9POVO9n5 I've spoken to Arizona mayors and county officials facing serious budget shortfalls due to COVID-19. The relief bill we passed will get local and tribal governments the support they need to combat the virus and start to recover from this pandemic. https://t.co/tUhwAAVamf On #InternationalWomensDay, the White House has nominated two women to lead important combatant commands, Air Force Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost and Army Lt. Gen. Laura Richardson. If confirmed, they'll be the second and third women to hold such roles. https://t.co/YeVQoz6Sz1 The COVID relief bill we passed this weekend will make sure Arizona families get the direct support they need to keep the lights on, keep the water running, and keep food on their tables. 
https://t.co/wVsT5tCDfH One of my priorities for this COVID-19 relief bill was to support Arizona seniors by getting additional funding for the meal delivery, caregiving, vaccine, and other services they need right now. 

I‚Äôm glad we were able to pass these provisions. https://t.co/m0g2ocinca We just passed a COVID-19 relief bill that will provide immediate support to Arizona working families and small businesses, help reopen schools safely, get vaccines into peoples‚Äô arms, and get our economy back on track.
https://t.co/tPGJ8MC5Td It‚Äôs been a long night. But this is important work. We‚Äôre close to passing a relief bill that will help beat this virus and get support to Arizonans who need it most.
¬†
Help is on the way. I worked to make sure this COVID relief package established community navigator programs to help Arizona small businesses, including Spanish-speaking and rural small businesses, get the support they need.
https://t.co/pUdUhzZp5C .@NASA might not have spotted any plant life on Mars, but that won‚Äôt stop me from trying. https://t.co/v0SVKcT335 I‚Äôve heard heart-wrenching stories from seniors facing isolation, food insecurity, and problems getting the COVID-19 vaccine. That‚Äôs why I'm working to ensure the COVID relief bill includes support for Arizona seniors. https://t.co/VwhBLBiQgq Starting today, you can join @AZStateMuseum for a three-part Zoom talk series celebrating #WomensHistoryMonth with presentations on the leadership of Indigenous American Women and their contributions to Arizona.

Welcome to AZ, @JJWatt. https://t.co/TCYe7ekJnl I‚Äôm proud to support @RepDebHaaland's historic nomination to be the first Native American Secretary of the @Interior. I look forward to working with her, Republicans, and Democrats to protect public lands and invest in Arizona's water infrastructure. https://t.co/7x3AZaf4Ze The @EPA has awarded new contracts for uranium mine clean-up on the Navajo Nation, a critical step to protecting public health. This week, @SenatorSinema and I also introduced a bill to prevent future uranium mining around the Grand Canyon.
https://t.co/nVC74GvOlf Last week, I volunteered again with @MobileMealsSoAZ to help deliver prepared meals to seniors in need. We all have to do our part to support at-risk communities in this pandemic, and I was proud to do mine. https://t.co/NQ1ltrWeOQ This month, I had the opportunity to join the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and share updates on how I‚Äôm working with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to help Arizona combat COVID-19 and get our economy back on track.
https://t.co/6Cx304JLiu .@GrandCanyonNPS may be millions of years old, but today marks 102 years since it became a U.S. national park. 

As one of Arizona‚Äôs greatest treasures, it‚Äôs our job to protect it for future generations. I‚Äôll never stop fighting to do just that. https://t.co/jJB7K1yIV6 Lots of firsts in the Senate, including signing my first bill just before it was introduced. My Border Business COVID Rescue Act will support small businesses along Arizona‚Äôs border facing unique challenges in this pandemic. 

Read more about it here: https://t.co/aOrSH2RCFq https://t.co/qPSa6EZBOt As we continue celebrating #BlackHistoryMonth in AZ, I‚Äôm proud to see former Flagstaff Mayor Coral Evans recognized as one of the many great Black leaders serving their local communities. I‚Äôm also honored that she now serves as a member of our Senate team.
https://t.co/EIeu10uXha The Continued Funding for Senior Services During COVID-19 Act will address some of the most difficult issues seniors face in this pandemic by supporting programs and organizations helping Arizona seniors with food assistance, caregiving, transportation, and vaccine distribution. Seniors are one of the communities being hit hardest in this pandemic. They face isolation, food insecurity and issues both signing up for and getting to vaccine appointments. Today I introduced a bill to support seniors with my colleagues on @SenateAging. https://t.co/Y8cuN56dzn Thanks to a new grant, the @AZCoalition for Military Families will be able to continue helping Arizona service members, veterans, and their families during the COVID-19 crisis. https://t.co/TaO6sVxDnA NEWS: @CVSHealth is beginning its pharmacy vaccine program in Arizona, which is an important step towards expanding distribution and increasing options for Arizonans ‚Äî including in some of our rural communities and small towns. https://t.co/DiNkAw2w52 If confirmed, @RepDebHaaland would be the first Native American to lead @Interior. It's important to me that Arizona's tribal governments are heard in this process, so today, I shared several letters from Arizona tribes supporting her nomination. https://t.co/osEhQD5ueY Exercising safely during a pandemic can be challenging, but with online fitness classes like those offered by Tucson‚Äôs JCC, you can stay active from the comfort of your own home. 
https://t.co/9H5M6AGWSx Today, @SenatorSinema and I introduced the Grand Canyon Protection Act to protect the Grand Canyon area from uranium mining. I've seen the canyon‚Äôs beauty from space and up close. I know the economic impact it has on Arizona. It must be preserved. I had a blast answering questions from students from Peoria and Tucson while we watched the live broadcast of the @NASAPersevere Mars landing with a @NASAJPL engineer. Thank you to the students for asking such creative questions and for letting me join you. #CountdownToMars https://t.co/m8093jBw86 Mental health support is crucial for service members, veterans, and their families. @RedCrossAZ‚Äôs free workshops aim to build resilience and coping skills, manage stress, and ease symptoms related to trauma.
https://t.co/4ISr8SEC7U The effects of climate change on low-income, Black, and Latino Arizonans can lead to dire consequences in Arizona‚Äôs heat. We must combat the threats of climate change to protect the communities being hit the hardest.
https://t.co/ZMV6bO7YIx In 1964, Sidney Poitier was the first Black man to win an Academy Award for best actor. @ASU_filmschool's choice to carry his name is a celebration of his contributions to American cinema and a testament to his undeniable talent.  #BlackHistoryMonth 
https://t.co/uvZ3ZafF51 Really appreciate the birthday call I got from fellow @USNavy pilot and @NASA astronaut, @AstroVicGlover.

https://t.co/0Vju8FCT43 .@LukeAFB trains some of the best pilots in the world, and I appreciate the opportunity to see their operations up close and take a spin in the F-35 simulator. Excited to support their mission through my work on @SASCDems. https://t.co/fYI6BDXgI2 Honored to share that I've been named Chair of @SASCDems Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, which will allow me to work with commanders in Arizona and across the U.S. that are focused on retaining our competitive edge over our adversaries. https://t.co/6PBs2Ok3dw The most important thing we can do right now to beat COVID-19 is getting more vaccine shots into Arizonans' arms so we can build herd immunity and begin getting our economy back on track.
https://t.co/lMv5bbO4XJ I‚Äôm honored to continue Arizona‚Äôs legacy of service on @SASCDems. I look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats, and Arizona defense leaders, to protect and expand our role in our national defense and meet the threats we face around the world. https://t.co/Ytn2SAP6fc I remember the first time I saw the Grand Canyon from space. Even from hundreds of miles away, it's still an amazing sight to see.

https://t.co/HOjk9PNzHj Small businesses on Arizona's border face unique challenges in this pandemic, so today I introduced my first bill with Sen. @JohnCornyn to get border businesses the resources they need so we can save jobs and they can keep their doors open. 
https://t.co/aOrSH2RCFq https://t.co/GdLw8zxH7W Arizonans struggling to pay rent due to unemployment and other reasons linked to COVID will soon be able to receive support through a federally-funded program we passed in December‚Äôs emergency COVID relief agreement.
https://t.co/xb1CIuBG73 In the wake of this pandemic, our top priority must be to keep Arizonans safe and healthy and get our economy back on track. With these Senate committee assignments, I‚Äôll be able to continue my work ensuring we do just that. And on @JECDems, I‚Äôll be working with Republican and Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate on economic policy that supports small businesses, spurs job growth, and creates opportunities for workers to learn the skills they need to secure good-paying jobs. By serving on the @EnergyDems and @EPWCmte, I‚Äôll be able to protect Arizona‚Äôs natural resources and public lands while investing in the infrastructure and renewable energy needed to fuel our economic recovery and create good-paying jobs across Arizona. https://t.co/HbLII5qYtE On @SASCDems, I‚Äôll be able to put my experience in the Navy and at NASA to work, advocating for Arizona‚Äôs defense priorities. And on @DemsOnAging, I‚Äôll be able to tackle the mounting issues seniors are facing because of this pandemic. https://t.co/MBLJtiTg66 I‚Äôm proud to share that I‚Äôll be serving on five committees in the U.S. Senate. These assignments will allow me to tackle the issues Arizonans sent me here to work on by doing what I do best: pushing through the partisan politics to restore a reliance on science, data, and facts. https://t.co/v5a7vru0o2 Arizona‚Äôs tribal communities continue to be disparately impacted by this pandemic, which is why I‚Äôll continue working with them to ensure they receive the support they need to keep their communities safe.
https://t.co/hjGwlts0h9 This pandemic hasn‚Äôt been easy for anyone, but the burden it‚Äôs put on Arizona‚Äôs seniors and their caregivers cannot be understated. Meeting with my Senior Advisory Group reinforced what I know to be true: We must do more to support Arizona seniors. There‚Äôs no time to waste. https://t.co/t17DKqHq0n AZ needs more doses to expand vaccination sites ‚Äî like the one @POTUS and @VP toured today ‚Äî while ensuring rural and border areas have the resources to vaccinate their communities. We also must prioritize vaccinating essential workers, including farmworkers and DHS employees. Getting Arizonans vaccinated is how we‚Äôre going to beat this virus and get our economy back on track. That's why @SenatorSinema and I are requesting an additional 300,000 vaccines immediately and 300,000 more vaccines added to Arizona's weekly allotment. https://t.co/P5JjGUiUSh I wrote a letter to introduce this month‚Äôs edition of @InBusinessPHX to highlight the task before us: As we continue to fight this pandemic, we must also continue working to protect jobs and get our economy back on track.

By supporting Arizona restaurants now, we can protect jobs and ensure they'll be there in the future. Today, the #DreamAct was reintroduced. It's time for us to pass it to permanently protect Dreamers ‚Äî who are just as American as my own daughters. We also need to reform our immigration system in a way that reflects our values and strengthens our economy.¬†#HomeIsHere I look forward to working with @SecretaryPete to improve Arizona's transportation infrastructure ‚Äî particularly in rural and tribal communities. Transportation directly impacts economic opportunity, and infrastructure investments will create jobs and help rebuild our economy. Made a new friend on the way to work yesterday. Looked an awful lot like @StationCDRKelly if you ask me. https://t.co/ycJvnBRmd3 Such a loss for the Navajo Nation and for all of Arizona. @GabbyGiffords and I offer our condolences to Albert Hale‚Äôs family and all who knew and admired him. https://t.co/nbYaYzbv44 When I spoke with Sec. @AliMayorkas, I shared the unique challenges facing border communities.

https://t.co/s8lrduATHO In addition to fighting for resources to tackle this pandemic, I‚Äôve been working to make sure Arizonans have access to clean water for generations to come by investing in Arizona‚Äôs water infrastructure.

It's the 35th anniversary of the Space Shuttle Challenger tragedy in which we lost 7 brave space explorers.
 
As President Reagan said, they served all of us ‚Äî and in the process, inspired so many. I'm thinking of them and their families today.
https://t.co/OwhTiwpItw It's critical that Arizona families have access to affordable health care ‚Äî especially in a pandemic. Reopening the federal health care exchange is a critical step to help get there.
https://t.co/3lPb2jeKZn I‚Äôm working with a group of Republican and Democratic senators and the administration to get support to Arizonans who need help getting through this crisis. https://t.co/1NDdRgZLJ5 Over 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.¬†It‚Äôs one of the darkest moments in human history, and it‚Äôs our job to make sure it never happens again. 

On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, remember that we won't accept hate in any of its forms. Period. Our government is at its best when it‚Äôs transparent and accountable. That‚Äôs why I‚Äòm posting my official Senate schedule so Arizonans can see how I‚Äôm working to serve them. You can follow what I‚Äôve been doing each week in the Senate at https://t.co/9o5ZlRnKCE. Our national defense is at its strongest when everyone able and willing to serve our country in the military can do just that. Good to see President Biden overturning the transgender military service ban.
https://t.co/lg5sFf7977 I‚Äôm working with my Republican and Democratic colleagues and the administration to find more ways to continue supporting Arizonans through this health and economic crisis. We‚Äôve got to do more to get relief to those who need it most right now.

This is a start, but more needs to be done to help Arizonans get through this pandemic.

Arizona small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the heart of our communities. We must do everything we can to support them through these difficult times.

To you and yours ‚Äî Happy New Year, Arizona! While in Tucson, I visited the Mercado District to hear from small business owners about the challenges they continue to face in this pandemic.

Surprise billing has financially wrecked too many families in Arizona and across the country. Thankfully, we passed protections for Arizonans from huge out-of-network costs that can bankrupt families in their time of need. https://t.co/MpKr96ct6N For every $1 spent on event tickets, it's estimated that $12 of economic activity is generated for area businesses like restaurants and hotels. That's why I co-sponsored the #SaveOurStagesAct and was glad to see it pass in the emergency relief package.
https://t.co/Z4qjR9O8dj I‚Äôm proud to see our Director of Constituent Services, Travonne Smith, recognized as part of the @THispanicChmbr‚Äôs 40 under 40 for her work in the Tucson community. Congratulations to Travonne and everyone recognized this year. https://t.co/gEpfQ1rso2 While not perfect, this bipartisan budget agreement strengthens our national defense and advances Arizona priorities like water infrastructure, solar power, protections against surprise billing, and job investments that will help us rebuild our economy.
https://t.co/uRmeGQPABD This emergency relief will help struggling families and small businesses, but partisan fighting slowed it down, making it too late for many in Arizona. I'm working with colleagues in both parties on what we can do next to get our economy back on track.
https://t.co/GN4flEtxR2 America is in the middle of a health and economic crisis. To get our country back on track, we all must do our part to fight the spread of COVID-19 ‚Äî including getting the vaccine when it becomes available to us. https://t.co/A7YJ7t9eP4 Arizona hospitals will receive $115 million in relief funds to make up for lost revenue this year. Our hospitals are on the frontlines of this pandemic, and it‚Äôs critical that they continue receiving the relief necessary to continue treating Arizonans. https://t.co/rfCLo4bGLu Was grateful to receive the COVID-19 vaccine today with @SenatorSinema. I encourage all Arizonans to take it when it‚Äôs available. In the meantime, we all must do our part by wearing a mask, social distancing, and not gathering in large groups.¬†#MaskUpAZ https://t.co/NaXY0tYTfU As Hanukkah comes to a close, I wanted to say: Happy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year, Arizona ‚Äî from my family to yours. https://t.co/AOVLFzniRP ICYMI: The Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act with bipartisan support. The bill will strengthen our national security and support missions at Arizona's military bases that are important to Arizona's economy. I was proud to vote for it. https://t.co/ijXd6nyKkT I‚Äôm urging all Arizonans to: stay home as much as possible, not gather in large groups, and wear a mask when you have to go out. #MaskUpAZ I met with my COVID-19 Working Group for the second time and what I heard is that AZ is in a worse position than we were earlier this year, with even fewer mitigation measures. Our health care system is being stretched past the breaking point. We must take action to stop it. https://t.co/YrBI5hpYh2 Last night, I met with @FlgChamber. We discussed how hard Flagstaff businesses are working to survive the economic crisis this pandemic has created. I‚Äôm working in the Senate now to pass a relief bill that will get small businesses the support they need. https://t.co/FdCWzrJFLd The Navajo Nation has worked hard to tackle this pandemic in the face of serious challenges, and a Major Disaster Declaration would provide more funding and flexibility to put towards slowing the spread of the virus and protecting public health as cases and hospitalizations rise. .@SenatorSinema and I joined members of the Arizona delegation in asking President Trump to support Navajo Nation President @NNPrezNez's request for a Major Disaster Declaration so Navajo Nation can access additional resources to combat the coronavirus pandemic. https://t.co/gnvxdSaZex How awesome is this? The first person in Arizona to receive the COVID-19 vaccine is a WWII veteran. This hero has seen so much, and with the distribution of this vaccine, I'm hopeful he'll get to add seeing this virus wiped out to the list.

https://t.co/6BRvfzmAtZ Thankful for the good Samaritans and Coast Guard who are helping sailors caught in this storm. 

Becky and I will keep praying for those missing and their families. Praying for everyone around Grand Isle and all the communities in South Louisiana. 

You can report marine distress to the Coast Guard at 504 365 2209.

Please stay safe in the storm. What do Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Hassan Rouhani, Bashar al-Assad, Nicol√°s Maduro, and Burmese generals have in common? 

They're all lined up to get hundreds of millions and even billions from Biden‚Äôs @USTreasury.

That‚Äôs a problem. https://t.co/wMRUzMdchm Chinese ‚Äúsolar panels may be the fruit of forced labor‚Äù at the expense of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.

Biden just doesn‚Äôt care about the #BorderCrisis because he PLANS to admit millions of illegal immigrants into our country this year. https://t.co/ESMKAmEz9z Louisianians work hard and deserve representatives who go to the mat for them. 

I‚Äôll keep fighting for legislation that makes their voices heard, creates jobs, defends the unborn, and protects our constitutional rights.

This $42M will help keep kids safe and keep communities healthy through routine vaccinations.

https://t.co/DpjhEsfbdi By aiming to spend $4 TRILLION of your taxpayer money in less than 100 days, the Biden admin is moving toward the Chinese model of capitalism.

This isn‚Äôt an infrastructure agenda‚Äîit‚Äôs about government domination. https://t.co/R58V2YNCFQ Is this an #AprilFools joke? 

Sec. Yellen confirms Biden‚Äôs Treasury wants to send billions to China, Russia, Iran and other bad actors without Congressional approval. 

That's a big ""yes"" from Biden to funding foreign dictators. https://t.co/CiALHKRh7p Dr. Tedros has issued a report in collaboration with China about where the #coronavirus came from. It closely tracks Chinese Communist propaganda. 

We‚Äôre only going to get answers if @WHO understands the U.S. will take its money and walk short of an independent investigation. https://t.co/mAgSNeUg8h The Chinese Communist Party is guilty of monstrous human rights violations. 

The Keep China Out of Solar Energy Act would make sure American federal dollars don‚Äôt fund the CCP through the purchase of solar panels, which may be made with forced labor.

https://t.co/UhiMmiTTpI Even damaging hurricanes and an ice storm couldn‚Äôt slow down @LHSLadyGators. The team fought past adversity to successfully defend their title as Class 4A champions! 
 
Congratulations to the superstars, their coaches, and their LaGrange family! https://t.co/iUT5ijdsFg Pres. Biden is planning to raise taxes dramatically. 

This will have a profoundly bad impact on the economy: When you tax something, you get less of it‚Äînot more. Less prosperity, fewer jobs. https://t.co/83bRglKBDM Louisiana is the nation‚Äôs #1 exporter of liquefied natural gas, but our energy jobs are taking a beating at the hands of the president. 

We should make it easier, not harder, to export American LNG to countries that need it.

https://t.co/c4ahzUglnd Every other country knows that vetting people at the border is prudent: 
 
This #BorderCrisis is dangerous and expensive. 
 
It pushes down wages in America. 
 
It undermines the rule of law and legal immigration. 
 
It‚Äôs nonsense on a stick. https://t.co/tZFnbMqjIK The Biden admin needs to get off the bullet train to Chump-Town and tell Dr. Tedros to send his team back into China‚Äîand, if the Chinese don‚Äôt cooperate, we‚Äôre not going to support @WHO anymore.
 
Short of that, we‚Äôll never find out what happened with the origin of #coronavirus. https://t.co/KHKHOiYgjn As we honor Jesus‚Äô arrival into Jerusalem today, we remember the sacrifices He made for us and our salvation.

Biden‚Äôs #BorderCrisis policies. Smugglers take advantage of it.

All of these people have been used, and Biden has allowed them to be used. It breaks your heart. https://t.co/g4MQNxlulV It became clear to me today that 1 of 2 things is going on with the #BorderCrisis: 

1. Either Pres. Biden believes in OPEN borders, or 

2. The people Biden has put in charge of border security policy aren't qualified to manage a food truck. https://t.co/3tIrKimWLL It‚Äôs been a wild night at the border. Cartel members were laughing at America from across the river. 

People were streaming across the border because they know Pres. Biden won‚Äôt deport them. Unreal. https://t.co/7HPmkJzDII As I‚Äôve seen with my own eyes today, the Biden admin‚Äôs reckless policies are openly inviting criminals and cartels to flock to the border.

It‚Äôs more urgent than ever that we ensure dangerous people can‚Äôt find cover in American communities. Here's how:

https://t.co/wOsNpL30bq It is time to put the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act to work by demanding honesty from every firm on a U.S. exchange.  

Foreign companies will comply with our laws, or we will kick them off our exchanges. https://t.co/NThZ4m3f29 Exciting news: The red snapper count is estimated to be 3x higher than was thought. Louisiana relies heavily on a healthy seafood economy‚Äîhere‚Äôs to good snapper seasons ahead!

https://t.co/O8M8Uez5gt After 20 years of @drewbrees's success as an NFL quarterback, I join countless Louisianians in honoring this Super Bowl champion. 

https://t.co/UBIkFMBgEk More on Biden admin‚Äôs plan to support China, Iran, Russia, &amp; powers that oppose U.S. values:

‚ÄúThe IMF wants to issue $1 trillion of this new funny money, and Treasury is so gung-ho that it‚Äôs scrambling to duck U.S. law requiring congressional approval.‚Äù

https://t.co/J0gldkWiN6 Confused about how Pres. Biden's Treasury is planning to unilaterally bail out China, Iran, Russia, and other hostile regimes with billions of your taxpayer money?
 
Let‚Äôs start with IMF loans that these foreign powers don‚Äôt have to pay back and will cash in for U.S. dollars. https://t.co/0s6n0PSu9D Pres. Biden inherited the most secure border of my lifetime‚Äîas the results of a Republican Congress and the Trump Administration. 

What did Biden do immediately? He got rid of all the policy and practices we implemented to secure that border. https://t.co/oemBKmcmMf It‚Äôs encouraging to see the abortion rate in Louisiana fall to a 12-year low, but I pray for the day that no child is lost to abortion. 

Louisiana has always been a #ProLife leader, and we‚Äôll continue to protect God‚Äôs greatest gift‚Äîlife.
 
https://t.co/JlIS78lUbA The IMF‚Äôs special drawing rights proposal would give billions to repressive regimes and state-sponsors of terrorism like China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, &amp; Syria.

@SecYellen should stop backing this dangerous plan, which depends on U.S. taxpayer dollars.

https://t.co/3tmuQO0Nzu Association health plans help small employers get their people health benefits they otherwise couldn‚Äôt access. The Association Health Plans Act would ensure Louisiana families and workers have easier access to quality, affordable health care.

Beijing is clinging to the oppressive influence it cultivated on U.S. campuses.

https://t.co/WbPPUP7cXJ The #BorderCrisis highlights the shortsightedness of President Biden‚Äôs immigration agenda. Our immigration system is in chaos, and we need laws that protect Americans and reward people who follow our laws.

https://t.co/dd61Ifi6eE Thankful for this HHS funding that will support research initiatives in north and south Louisiana. Medical research is key to providing good care to Louisianians who face health challenges.

https://t.co/ivVLN2ZccE As central and north Louisiana celebrate #318Day, it‚Äôs worth recalling the talent of Ouachita‚Äôs Allison Litwin, who won the Congressional High School Art Competition for her district in 2019.
 
Happy 318 Day to all the folks who call the 318 home! https://t.co/RIg3u9pni2 Pres. Biden created this #BorderCrisis, and he can fix it‚Äîby reimplementing the Trump Administration policies, which were working.

It‚Äôs not a mystery. https://t.co/120ZVbuZMb Many small businesses rely on FAST grants to succeed and innovate, but these funds aren‚Äôt reaching the communities that need them most.
 
The FAST Fix Act would prioritize applicants in historically underserved places like Louisiana.

https://t.co/571G7DqwK9 Proud to join the Louisiana Delegation in working to extend the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area authorization for another 15 years. It‚Äôs a jewel of Cajun culture and Acadiana‚Äôs natural beauty.

https://t.co/UzpS178Gxf News you can use: Louisianians who went to hotels during the recent winter storms may have incurred expenses not covered by their insurance policies. 

In some cases, FEMA may reimburse these expenses under the federal disaster declaration.

https://t.co/BBNCyQmMuU As Louisiana prepares for turbulent weather, be ready ahead of time to find appropriate shelter from any tornadoes.
 
Take a moment to check out tips for sheltering safely! https://t.co/VBty6D33uL In one of his first official acts, Pres. Biden suspended border wall construction and ordered a freeze of funds Congress provided for that purpose.

As a result, a humanitarian crisis is raging at the border.

I'm proud to lead bipartisan legislation that supports the independence of local newspapers.

https://t.co/FffRUg9i2A Deeply saddened to see govt punish foster services for their religious beliefs. That discrimination hurts kids who are waiting for loving, healthy homes. 

No govt agency that discriminates against people on the basis of faith deserves taxpayer money.

https://t.co/MtTDX4TC5A The American people support legal immigration. I certainly do. 

The American people also believe that illegal immigration is illegal. They believe that vetting people at the border isn‚Äôt racist‚Äîit‚Äôs prudent. https://t.co/XDg7eAXoLT The death tax is lethal to many family-run businesses and farms.

Ending this illogical tax burden will make it much easier for Louisiana families to pass their businesses on to the next generation.

https://t.co/rKrEumSKAB Without order, there can be no justice. We shouldn‚Äôt take resources from hardworking small biz owners and give them to criminals convicted of felony rioting. 

But Dems just blocked my effort to keep SBA $ from going to criminal rioters. What‚Äôs wrong with the Left's priorities? This advance in the Mid-Barataria Project marks a big milestone in the fight to restore our eroding coastlines.

https://t.co/pKBVLkBQmx A month into his term, Pres. Biden has given Louisiana and the U.S. a sucking chest wound.

He ended Keystone, halted oil and gas leasing, and cancelled a March 17 lease sale that Obama approved.

The Linemen Legacy Act would legally add utility line technicians to Homeland Security‚Äôs list of first-responder occupations. https://t.co/8GXDQXjXKu Teachers and parents on the ground deserve the credit for getting almost 70% of Louisiana kids back in the classroom.¬†

https://t.co/dqN8FGBkzQ It's not complicated. Becerra‚Äôs lack of health care experience, enthusiasm for replacing private health insurance with govt programming, and embrace of radical policies on immigration, abortion, and religious liberty mean he's unfit to be HHS Secretary.

https://t.co/qxBKl3f6Ya President Biden just cancelled an oil and gas lease sale worth tens of millions of dollars‚Äîone that the Obama Administration approved. 

I urge President Biden to stop his war on Louisiana‚Äôs oil and gas jobs.

https://t.co/X34ptlA5nY How many Democrats voted against adding seats to the Supreme Court? Not a single one.

It‚Äôs not enough that Democrats control the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives. They‚Äôre determined to control #SCOTUS, too. I asked my colleagues to ensure that @SBAgov assistance can‚Äôt go to people found guilty of felony or misdemeanor rioting. Seems simple, smart, and fair‚Äîright?

Democrats banded together to defeat this common-sense step that supports job creators. Freedom of religion is one of our most sacred liberties. There‚Äôs never a moment when we can take it for granted, least of all during a pandemic. I‚Äôm thankful to affirm that with 49 of my colleagues this evening.

Unfortunately, Democrats still blocked this amendment. The Keystone XL pipeline supports American jobs, America‚Äôs energy independence, and America‚Äôs national security.

Why Pres. Biden shut it down and 48 Senate Democrats just voted to keep it closed is beyond me. Late at night, Democrats voted to protect the SALT deduction for high-earners in blue states‚Äîonly days after Pres. Biden unilaterally moved to kill 48,000 Louisiana jobs by 2022? 

You can‚Äôt make this this stuff up! The question isn‚Äôt why the Senate had to pass an amendment to ensure that Pres. Biden‚Äôs EPA can‚Äôt ban fracking. We know that his war on energy jobs is plowing ahead. 

The question is why 43 Senate Democrats voted against our effort to save jobs that produce clean natural gas. Withholding medical attention from babies who survive attempted abortions is murder. Senate Democrats just voted AGAINST holding health care workers who deny medical care to these babies accountable. 

Horrifying. Pres. Biden‚Äôs ban on oil and gas leasing costs LA‚Äôs coastal restoration efforts big. 

Turns out students are casualties of the ban, too‚Äîand the Senate KNOWS it. 

I voted to recover funding for schools that lose $ to this moratorium. It‚Äôs insane Biden put kids in this position. Sanctuary cities put communities at risk. 

Police need to be able to work with federal authorities to get dangerous criminals off the streets, but EVERY Senate Democrat just voted to fund states that refuse to let law enforcement do its job. Our kids need to be back in schools. 

Senate Democrats just voted to send Covid $ to schools that choose to stay closed after teachers are vaccinated. 

This foolishness hurts students and helps no one. If a state is under investigation for underreporting deaths in its nursing homes, why would we send tons more $ to its governor? 

You‚Äôd have to ask Senate Democrats. They voted against reducing funding for states making such epic mistakes. I say this firmly but gently: Americans are tired of being lectured by the managerial elites who think they‚Äôre special.

Pres. Biden‚Äôs federal leasing ban would eliminate 48,000 direct energy jobs in Louisiana by 2022 and another 8,000 high-paying jobs in water management and coastal restoration. https://t.co/dzKlcMlZ5s How has President Biden already targeted energy workers? Let‚Äôs count the ways:

Revoked Keystone XL pipeline permit
Halted new oil and gas leasing and permitting on fed lands/waters
Froze current leasing programs
Stopped new fracking on fed lands

In the days ahead, I remain hopeful for a path for bipartisan work that can address the problems facing our nation ‚Äì but the outstanding question is how Senator McConnell and his caucus will play their hand. I‚Äôll be watching closely. The dangers of the filibuster are especially pronounced on the issues of voting rights, as states across the nation pursue nakedly partisan voter-suppression legislation. If forced to choose between a Senate rule and democracy itself, I know where I will come down. This argument against removing the filibuster only works if the 60-vote threshold is used sparingly and in good-faith ‚Äì not in a concerted effort to block any and all policies of the majority party. I've long been wary of filibuster reform ‚Äì fearing that a 51-seat margin would be a double-edged sword that could endanger the social safety net, healthcare protections, environmental protections, and more.

Hope you can listen! https://t.co/O2gDcyFnAk A changing Arctic opens up both opportunities and threats for America ‚Äì which is why it is so vital that the U.S. works with our allies and partners to reinforce international norms in the region. https://t.co/xgAAu0UlbV I‚Äôm proud to have fought for this fund, which will help struggling restaurants cover payroll, rent, utilities, and more. I urge affected Maine restaurants to apply for this aid once @SBAgov begins accepting applications. Maine restaurants are economic innovators that create jobs and contribute to the local flavor of our state. Now, the American Rescue Plan is taking long-overdue steps to support the restaurants that have been hit hard by COVID-19. https://t.co/pPeddBcJje 201 years of natural beauty, tight-knit towns, and independent spirit. Happy birthday, Maine. https://t.co/z3JLi54EuY The pandemic has exacerbated a digital divide that keeps too many Mainers from accessing high-speed broadband. Fortunately, the American Rescue Plan includes key funding that will help our communities expand connectivity both during and after this crisis.
https://t.co/cuytLQtgxw Our nation‚Äôs healthcare heroes have given so much of themselves to care for others during this pandemic ‚Äì often at cost of their own mental health and well-being. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to support the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act. https://t.co/jGFSDN5sfu The American Rescue Plan will provide vital funds for Maine businesses ‚Äì from funding for broadband and the agricultural industry to support for restaurants and live performance venues. @Mainebiz has a great overview: https://t.co/CAitfgm2WA I am immensely proud to have supported this bill to deliver help to Maine people in need, and stand ready to continue working with my colleagues and the White House to take any additional action that is needed to beat this pandemic. The American people agree that American Rescue Plan is exactly the bill we need to meet this moment, with recent polling showing that 77% of the American public supports this plan, including 6 in 10 Republicans. This rare consensus reflects the immense need being felt by so many. ‚Ä¶stimulus checks, funding to aid small businesses, a dedicated fund for restaurants, additional resources for school districts, increased support for working families and historic investments to expand broadband access and close the digital divide. The pandemic has attacked our economy, strained working families, endangered small businesses, and exacerbated longstanding inequalities that have been left unaddressed for decades. The American Rescue Plan confronts these challenges through extended unemployment insurance... This package will address the ongoing public health emergency by providing ample funding to support vaccination, testing, tracing, and other key medical needs that are required to control this virus. But as all Americans know, this crisis did not only affect our nation‚Äôs health. Over the past year, COVID-19 has killed more than 500,000 Americans and exacted a devastating toll on our economy. The American Rescue Plan is the right bill for this moment ‚Äì and with President Biden‚Äôs signature, I'm grateful to tell Maine people that help is on the way. https://t.co/ZsjpipcXQ3 From distance learning to remote work to telemedicine, high-speed broadband has been essential during this pandemic ‚Äì but for too many Maine people, this tool has been out of reach. I‚Äôm proud to have worked with my colleagues and the White House to help expand broadband access. Fantastic news for Maine broadband ‚Äì the American Rescue Plan includes $10 billion to support broadband across the nation, and will bring more than $100 million here to Maine to close the digital divide. https://t.co/MajK7bQ5ae Merrick Garland is eminently qualified to serve as Attorney General, with an impressive judicial record and a depth of knowledge that rivals any legal mind in the nation. He is the right leader for @TheJusticeDept at this moment, and I was proud to support his confirmation. We're closer than ever to getting the COVID-19 pandemic under control ‚Äì but with new variants of the virus potentially prolonging this pandemic, we can't let up now. @BillCassidy and I are urging @CDCgov to closely watch these new strains: https://t.co/P4quwTTSq5 Great to talk with the Maine Municipal Association this morning about funding in the American Rescue Plan to support states and localities. These local leaders have provided key services throughout the pandemic, and these funds will help them continue to serve our communities. https://t.co/3ijnfezJX6 In ~15 minutes I‚Äôll join @AlisynCamerota on @NewDay to discuss the American Rescue Plan‚Äôs work to deliver vital relief to communities in need, and the Russian disinformation effort to undermine faith in coronavirus vaccines. Hope you can tune in! To confront the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to address both the health risks and the economic fallout. This morning, I joined @MorningEdition to discuss the importance of passing the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/xwAnoOSxe0 Throughout Maine and across the globe, the contributions and leadership of women are invaluable and essential. On this #InternationalWomensDay, we must all recommit ourselves to the work of advancing gender equality all over the world. The American Rescue Plan will help save lives, support households, stabilize small businesses, lift children out of poverty, make our communities whole, and deliver for our medical and safety professionals. I was proud to support this bill. https://t.co/hsc5IcbtHn For a year, America has been devastated by COVID-19 ‚Äì costing 500,000 lives and inflicting immense economic harm across the nation. That‚Äôs why I voted to deliver desperately needed relief where it is urgently needed. My full statement: https://t.co/Ek80vFXm6S I‚Äôm proud to work with @SenatorBennet, @Sen_JoeManchin, and @SenRobPortman to create a new baseline broadband standard so Americans of all backgrounds have access to high-speed connectivity that can keep pace with the speed of modern life. A slow internet connection isn‚Äôt just a nuisance ‚Äì it‚Äôs a barrier that prevents people from work, school or medical attention. The federal government‚Äôs standard for ‚Äúhigh-speed‚Äù broadband is stuck in the slow lane; we need to update this standard. https://t.co/MRHMWs53cz On January 6th, the Capitol police were vastly outnumbered, and went without backup for over 3 hours before the National Guard arrived. Clearly, this process needs a fix. Today, I questioned Major General Walker of @DCGuard1802 on how we can ensure this never happens again. https://t.co/em6XPHnKIM From Acadia to Zion, America‚Äôs national parks are treasures that help Americans of all backgrounds connect with the great outdoors and make lifelong memories; it will be my honor to protect these lands as Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks. https://t.co/ekkK8A0iee The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges and substance use disorders across the nation ‚Äì fortunately, two Maine organizations are receiving more than $6 million to address these threats to our communities. https://t.co/48qFCO2RuG Maine‚Äôs restaurants add personality (and flavor) to our communities and economy ‚Äîbut the pandemic has hit them hard, putting livelihoods and small businesses at risk. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm supporting the RESTAURANTS Act to protect these local businesses. https://t.co/K6AeneSfSz It was such a pleasure to virtually meet with this year‚Äôs Maine Delegates to the Senate Youth Program ‚Äì Iann Leigh of Bangor and Scott Peterson of Nobleboro. They are bright, dedicated, and energetic ‚Äì I can‚Äôt wait to see what challenges they take on in the future! https://t.co/EqCyxOvh3O The coronavirus pandemic has shown just how essential high-speed broadband is to our economy and society ‚Äì but the digital divide is widening, leaving too many Americans behind. As Congress debates COVID relief, broadband access should be a top priority. https://t.co/b5VBF8tGjG The @USPS has been a lifeline for so many during this pandemic ‚Äì but misguided policy changes are undercutting this American institution. This month, @SenGaryPeters and Maine letter carrier Mark Seitz join #InsideMaine to discuss the threats to USPS. https://t.co/0091GeMWDe Expanding access to the coronavirus vaccine is one of the most important things we can do to bring this pandemic under control and stabilize our economy. I‚Äôm committed to working with the White House to address bottlenecks and expedite our national effort. https://t.co/SrFdFJ5X7v This shouldn‚Äôt be a short-term fix ‚Äì it should be the foundation of an effort to promote digital equity. Yesterday, I led a letter with @SenatorHassan and @MarkWarner urging the FCC to use this program to help close the digital divide and expand access to high-speed broadband. https://t.co/MD1Ht9P1NU Broadband is an essential part of 21st century life ‚Äì especially during this pandemic. I‚Äôm thrilled by this move from the @FCC and @JRosenworcel, which will help ensure that more Americans can access the internet‚Äôs opportunities, no matter their income. https://t.co/f0ZLE7tNXb Also on today‚Äôs call, I congratulated Dominic LaJoie of Van Buren for his appointment as President of the National Potato Council for 2021! I‚Äôve long been impressed by Dominic‚Äôs passion, knowledge, and hard work ‚Äì I know he‚Äôll be succeed in this new role. https://t.co/Qeb56sCLrZ Maine‚Äôs potato farms are a source of state pride, and economic engines in our rural communities ‚Äì we need to make sure they continue to thrive. Today, I met with members of the Maine Potato Board to discuss how we can support this industry and the people who rely on it. https://t.co/Uk2Zh0xs9A Following yesterday‚Äôs hearing on the SolarWinds hack, I joined @Morning_Joe to discuss the ways America can address its cybervulnerabilities ‚Äì including a strong policy of deterrence, partnerships with the private sector, and increased international cooperation. WATCH: https://t.co/PwTe0JyFSx I‚Äôll join @Morning_Joe in ~15 minutes to discuss yesterday‚Äôs hearing with security officials on the intelligence failures that led to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, and what reforms are needed to make sure this can‚Äôt happen again. Cyberdeterrence is essential to national security ‚Äì our adversaries need to know that if they try launch a cyberattack at the United States, they will pay a price. https://t.co/yoVvfoH3Ze The Great American Outdoors Act, which passed last year, is one of the most consequential conservation laws of the last century ‚Äì but execution is just as important as vision. Today, I pressed @DebHaalandNM on the need to ensure this law is effectively implemented. https://t.co/5y3JsZKC7h 500,000 Americans have died from coronavirus ‚Äì half a million, gone forever, leaving loved ones and communities behind to mourn their passing. Today, we remember those who we have lost, and remind each other to be safe and slow the spread. #WearAMask, save a life. https://t.co/0wmmTa841T It was a pleasure to join @jbarro, @ddayen, and @herandrews on ‚ÄúLeft, Right and Center‚Äù to share the thinking of Senate moderates as we help shape the COVID-19 relief package making its way through Congress.  @LRCkcrw is a lively listen, and even more fun to participate in. https://t.co/jYcbT9Xa87 If you haven‚Äôt signed up for healthcare already, the Special Enrollment Period will be open until May 15th.

Your legacy lives on. https://t.co/UN5JbB2jlr The insurrection at the Capitol would not have happened 'but for‚Äô Donald Trump‚Äôs lies about the election‚Äôs legitimacy and his repeated calls for supporters to gather in Washington on January 6. For that reason, I voted to convict. My full statement: https://t.co/go4SfcFr7q Cyberattacks are an evolving, complicated threat to America‚Äôs national security, but our current cyber defenses are inadequate. That's why the @CyberSolarium is so committed to working with the public and private sector to strengthen our cybersecurity. https://t.co/QWr9uE32vN The House managers‚Äô presentations are straightforward: raw video and verbatim tweets that spell out the dangers at the Capitol on Jan. 6, the ongoing threat to our democratic system, and the importance of accountability. https://t.co/3ZA1ixftyo A ‚ÄúMade in USA‚Äù label helps inform consumers that they‚Äôre purchasing a quality product and supporting American jobs. Unfortunately, varied state regulations are creating a confusing, costly patchwork approach; it‚Äôs time to streamline the process. https://t.co/5Vtx6H6LqN Through powerful words and raw video, House managers today made an impressive case that lays bare how truly dangerous the events of January 6th were for both members of Congress and our democratic system. We need accountability. https://t.co/W3VZmCAbVD Underserved rural communities cannot be left behind in our fight to control the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, I joined a bipartisan group of Senators pushing for funds to be quickly disbursed to these rural regions. 
https://t.co/DgEPoWoATx In the days ahead, the Senate is about to embark on the first impeachment case in American history where the jurors are also eyewitnesses. I have taken an oath to ‚Äòdo impartial justice,‚Äô and I will take that oath seriously. My full statement: https://t.co/Hvmhrbuqcl The VA needs strong, experienced leadership to ensure that veterans in Maine and across the country get the high-quality care they have earned. I believe Denis McDonough is up to the task, and I was proud to support his confirmation as Secretary of Veterans Affairs today. https://t.co/ilnMufNm8d Maine families, communities, and businesses have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. They need relief ‚Äì now. I‚Äôm working hard alongside my colleagues to craft and quickly pass legislation that addresses this urgent crisis. https://t.co/O3vgfl84DG Crystal Waugh made a lasting impact on her community, helping so many Maine people enter recovery. Our state has lost yet another leader in the fight against substance use disorders; may we all honor her memory and carry on her work to end this epidemic. https://t.co/6vh2WSKr7I If you‚Äôre looking for a good weekend listen, check out my conversation with @bryancurtis and @thepressboxpod on life being covered by the Capitol Hill press corps and the need to improve our national media literacy. https://t.co/t0YLCdCTT5 It is critical that the next generation of leaders understands the complexity of the challenges ahead. I left the conversation impressed by the depth of knowledge from these Maine students; I‚Äôm confident that our state and our nation will benefit greatly from their contributions. From the threats of climate change and new national security risks to the opportunity of innovative economic activity, the Arctic will be central to Maine future. Thrilled to meet with Auburn students this week to discuss this region‚Äôs growing importance. https://t.co/cr3WEEd75c For months, the American people have been crying out for relief; this morning‚Äôs vote is a strong step toward meeting that need and addressing the pandemic's impacts. I hope this vote will lead to more substantive bipartisan negotiations in the days ahead. https://t.co/2xn2AiIFsq Maine‚Äôs logging industry has played a vital role in our state's rural communities for generations ‚Äì but the pandemic has brought new challenges for this storied economic sector. Proud to join the Maine delegation in pushing Congress to provide aid. https://t.co/n4HKQqH0n4 In the midst of a tough Maine winter and a once-in-a-generation public health crisis, it is essential that we support the LIHEAP program and make sure Maine families can heat their homes without sacrificing other necessities.  https://t.co/pvbA3ilVMo Great conversation with @BryanCurtis and @ThePressBoxPod about hosting ‚ÄúMaine Watch‚Äù on @MainePublic, media coverage of the Senate, and the value of asking good questions ‚Äì whether you‚Äôre a reporter or an elected official. Listen: https://t.co/RsWPFuC2PN Officer Brian Sicknick lost his life protecting our Capitol and our democracy on January 6. 

Today, he laid in honor in the Capitol Rotunda; tomorrow, and every day after, we will keep the memory of his sacrifice and his heroism alive. Officer Sicknick will never be forgotten. It‚Äôs simple: a woman and a man doing the same work should be paid the same amount. Unfortunately, even today the gender wage gap persists. I‚Äôm proud to cosponsor the Paycheck Fairness Act as we push for stronger accountability and fair and equal pay. https://t.co/LBCggVBSdV In this month‚Äôs edition of Inside Maine, Senator @LisaMurkowski and I discuss bipartisan solutions ahead in the 117th Congress, and the best way to come to an agreement on the next COVID-19 relief bill: by working together. 
https://t.co/NiemjplmFo Great news for @UMaine ‚Äì they‚Äôll receive $2.8m from @ENERGY to expand their leadership in offshore wind energy by using 3D printing technology to create wind blade molds. I'm proud of UMaine's work and excited to watch them harness renewables. https://t.co/w4bNhDM00n I hate this picture but felt it should be shared. Full thoughts on Instagram: https://t.co/CvLrYhbzns https://t.co/2JX85VHLAa Researchers at @UMaine are leading an innovative offshore wind project to harness our natural resources and help power the future with clean, renewable energy. Today, I invited Energy Secretary nominee Jennifer Granholm to come to Maine for a firsthand look at this work. https://t.co/cqcPBIJ5AA Today‚Äôs call between the White House and members of Congress was a bipartisan discussion focused on policy solutions ‚Äì which is notable in itself. Let's keep working together to speed vaccine distribution and support Americans during this pandemic. https://t.co/E19gh16nvs I‚Äôm proud to announce that I‚Äôve promoted Morgan Cashwell, a Winterport native and longtime member of my team, to serve as my new Legislative Director. Morgan has led energy and climate efforts for years, and I know she'll serve Maine well in this role. https://t.co/xXTi0dSgKd Mr. Secretary, congratulations on this historic achievement. Look forward to working with you to support America‚Äôs national security in the years ahead. https://t.co/IcWGGuGbt6 Yesterday was a unifying day for our nation ‚Äì now it‚Äôs time to get to work and pass legislation to help the American people. I told @MitchellReports I‚Äôm optimistic that Congress can work together to provide relief to states and localities and improve vaccine distribution. https://t.co/HO4mSFiwLf TUNE IN: ~ 12:05, I‚Äôll join @mitchellreports to discuss the first days of the new Administration and the transition. I look forward to working with a bipartisan group of colleagues and @POTUS to help the American people, revive our economy, and unify our nation. As President Lincoln said: it‚Äôs time to rise with the occasion. I believe that President Biden has the opportunity, the ability, and the character to unify our nation and make this government work for its people. Now, Congress must do its part, and come together on a bipartisan basis to improve the country we all love so dearly. More than 150 years later, it‚Äôs impossible to summarize this moment in American history, or the proper response, any better than Lincoln did. It‚Äôs time to think anew, and act anew, because we cannot allow our usual petty squabbles to hinder our response to the threats we face. He said: ‚ÄòThe dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.‚Äô At this urgent juncture, I find myself turning to the words one of our nation‚Äôs greatest citizens. As President Abraham Lincoln worked to preserve the Union during its most delicate time, he urged Congress to rise to the moment. A divided nation, where a few conflict-seeking voices on the fringes seem to drown out the majority who long for compromise. In the middle of these crises and more, we cannot simply settle into business-as-usual. Our nation is facing immense challenges. A pandemic that has already killed nearly 400,000 Americans, and still grows worse by the day. A foundering economy that is forcing too many Americans to make unimaginable choices. Through it all, the flame of democracy was protected by generations of patriots, public servants, and everyday citizens who put the long-term health of the nation ahead of short-term personal gain. Now, it is our turn to do the same. For nearly a quarter of a millennium, American government of the people, by the people, for the people has endured. This lasting success was not pre-ordained; our experiment in self-government has had to contend with wars and diseases, economic depressions and internal divisions. Today, we honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who spoke with clarity passion, and unparalleled talent to remind all who would hear him of the American promise that it‚Äôs character that counts, not race, religion, or national origin. My statement on #MLKDay: https://t.co/lEwudyZOYa Right now, America faces a series of crises which need federal action. I believe that in the coming days, Congress has both the opportunity and the will to work on a bipartisan basis to meet these challenges. The American people need Washington to lead ‚Äî so let‚Äôs get to it. https://t.co/o0FlBiU0XD Members of the Maine National Guard head to D.C. this weekend to provide security ahead of President-elect Biden‚Äôs inauguration, and support the peaceful transition of power that has long defined America‚Äôs system of government. Grateful for their service. https://t.co/ukkNKXnRoa Right now, the coronavirus is worse than it‚Äôs ever been in Maine ‚Äì but help is on the way. These funds will speed vaccine distribution and expand testing to help get this virus under control. Please, do your part: #WearAMask, and stay vigilant.¬†https://t.co/Vmk7ezEEIs Exactly 3 months ago, Maine recorded 28 new coronavirus cases.  
 
Today? A record-high 824 new cases. 
 
This is the worst the virus has ever been in Maine; please, increase your vigilance and wear a mask. For yourself, and for your loved ones.  https://t.co/GOuKf3HDD3 Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign to undermine our democratic system is the single most irresponsible act ever committed by a United States President in our history. He must be held accountable ‚Äì either through his resignation, the 25th Amendment, or impeachment. My full statement: https://t.co/peaZiAIs2j Never been called ‚ÄúAtticus Finch on a Harley‚Äù before ‚Äì but I don‚Äôt mind it! Thanks to @Jon_Wertheim and @60Minutes for shining their light on Maine and the need to put common sense before party politics in Washington. If you missed the segment, watch here: https://t.co/A5PFUazKNM At this fragile moment for our nation, I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to share Maine, our values, and vision for the future with @Jon_Wertheim and @60Minutes. I thank them for their time and thoughtful questions ‚Äî hope you can tune in tonight ~8PM! https://t.co/uGWefbMlNQ Calm in Maine; this beautiful shot was recently shared by a friend on the coast. I don‚Äôt know where to start to describe the week that just passed; our democracy had a close call, and our job now is to figure out how to prevent another. https://t.co/i3223962SD https://t.co/NHJG7buOkY I‚Äôm deeply saddened by the death of Officer Brian Sicknick, who gave his life defending our Capitol from Wednesday‚Äôs violent mob. My condolences are with his family, friends, and colleagues; those responsible for his death must be held accountable. American self-government is a 240-year anomaly in world history, which is largely defined by kings and tyrants. Our system is fragile; it rests upon trust. If we are to do our part to ensure this system survives, we cannot afford to pull bricks out from its foundation. https://t.co/Qvmk28mQ1Y To my colleagues, I say: President Trump cannot be verbally or silently enabled any longer ‚Äì whomever does not speak out is complicit in his efforts to poison the political debate and incite violence. My complete statement: https://t.co/s7OaHISuJ8 Today‚Äôs violent insurrection at the Capitol is an unspeakably sad moment for our nation, but this unprecedented, despicable display will not prevent Congress from completing the people‚Äôs business and affirming the undeniable fact that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. American democracy is unique in world history, which is typically defined by dictators and despots. Today, I will do my part to protect our nation‚Äôs experiment in self-government by voting to certify the election results. My colleagues who are supporting this week‚Äôs anti-democratic sideshow should listen to this recording, and think twice about if they‚Äôre truly ready to go down in history with a President who so clearly and desperately wants to delegitimize democracy. We would rightly condemn this behavior if it occurred in another nation, and we should oppose it even more forcefully at home. President Trump‚Äôs efforts to pressure the Georgia Secretary of State into actual election fraud would make Richard Nixon blush. Let‚Äôs call this what it is: an overt, corrupt attempt to overturn the will of the voters. President-Elect Biden will be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on January 20th. No attack launched by President Trump or his Congressional enablers will change that fact ‚Äì but their words can still wreak immense damage on our democratic systems. My statement: https://t.co/cyzQqqE6D5 In addition, these provisions will advance a thoughtful deterrence strategy that gives our adversaries pause before attempting to harm us. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and the incoming Biden Administration to improve our nation‚Äôs cyber capabilities. I‚Äôm particularly proud of the work done by this bill to improve our nation‚Äôs cybersecurity posture, including 27 provisions proposed by the @CyberSolarium that will strengthen American cyberdefenses to protect our nation's networks. Today, Congress has completed our bipartisan work on this year‚Äôs NDAA by overriding the President‚Äôs veto to enact legislation that will strengthen our national security, improve pay and care for our servicemembers, and support jobs across Maine. 2020 was a year unlike any in our lifetimes, but as we look ahead, I see reason for hope ‚Äì that when we come together again, we'll be reminded of our love for one another. Mary and I wish you all a happy and healthy New Year. https://t.co/IJxA8AJ3XD This bipartisan legislation was crafted to provide critical aid for unemployed Americans, struggling small businesses, food banks, and expanded vaccine distribution. We did our job for the American people, and are glad the President finally agreed. https://t.co/BdeOYNhnsd Nothing like a walk in the Maine woods to clear the head (be sure to turn on the sound). Millions lost unemployment yesterday ‚Äî and our President is in Florida playing golf and threatening to torpedo a Congressionally-passed bipartisan relief package. https://t.co/gRZLH72GWt https://t.co/dLUtOj7fns Christmas might look a little different this year, but the spirit remains the same ‚Äî expressing love and appreciation for the people who brighten our lives. Mary and I send you the warmest wishes for a healthy and safe holiday ‚Äî Merry Christmas! https://t.co/yxrq8RVaqJ Pardons for Manafort and Stone, which clearly rewards their silence, is an abuse of power, an affront to the Constitution, and an insult to the people of this country. For the second time in as many days, President Trump has made it clear he believes that his friends and associates don‚Äôt need to follow the same laws as the rest of us. In the days ahead, I hope that the large, veto-proof majorities which initially supported this legislation will come together once again to override the President‚Äôs veto ‚Äì for the good of our servicemembers and our nation. This NDAA is the single-most comprehensive piece of cybersecurity legislation ever passed by Congress; as we work to determine the harm done by the recent cyber incursion, the provisions in this legislation would be a shield against future tactics by our foes worldwide. By vetoing the overwhelmingly-bipartisan NDAA, President Trump is denying a pay raise for our nation‚Äôs servicemembers, undermining our national security, and threatening Maine jobs. A new record high, two days before Christmas. This holiday season, please be safe and smart ‚Äî for yourself, and your loved ones. Wear a mask, remain socially distant, and avoid unnecessary gatherings. https://t.co/RLY8khubDj Tonight, President Trump pardoned political cronies who lied to cover up for him; elected officials who enriched themselves on the taxpayers‚Äô dime; and Blackwater contractors who killed innocent Iraqi civilians.

This is not ‚Äúlaw and order;‚Äù it is straight-up corruption. Maine dawn; I‚Äôve had this shot for weeks but wanted to wait for the right time to post it. Last night, Congress passed critical COVID-19 relief ‚Äì there are important provisions missing from the bill, but it's a bipartisan step in the right direction. https://t.co/EQ7aQQCFhM https://t.co/YhSSHqYGJ7 This bill will do a lot of good, for a lot of people, but it is not enough. There is more work to do, and I hope that in the months ahead we will continue to negotiate in a bipartisan spirit to provide additional support to people in need. For months, the American people have been calling for a new coronavirus relief package. Today, after extensive bipartisan efforts and negotiation, we have reached an agreement to help our citizens in need weather the cold, dark winter ahead. TUNE IN: At 5pm, I‚Äôll be joining @NicolleDWallace to discuss the serious hack of our government‚Äôs IT infrastructure, as well as the bipartisan COVID relief agreement scheduled for a vote within hours. For decades, Maine Veterans‚Äô Homes has helped our state fulfill our duty to care for our veterans.

Mr. President, this is a critical moment. Please sign this bill. https://t.co/9eG2Z9CNEz I‚Äôll be joining @DanaBashCNN ~12:15pm to discuss the latest on the recently revealed cyberhacks, and the importance of signing this year‚Äôs NDAA ‚Äì and its 26 @CyberSolarium provisions ‚Äì into law to bolster our cyberdefenses. The NDAA includes 26 recommendations from @CyberSolarium to strengthen our nation‚Äôs cyber defenses. Given the recently revealed cyber hacks, it is more critical than ever that the President sign this bipartisan bill into law. https://t.co/wcBme0fSIY Tune in: I‚Äôll be joining @npratc at ~5:30 to discuss the latest cyber hacks, and the next steps Congress and the executive branch need to take in order to shore up our cyber defenses. The recently revealed cyber hacks are what we‚Äôve feared: our adversaries accessed our networks, without our knowledge. That‚Äôs why we must seriously strengthen our nation's cyberdefenses, starting by getting the NDAA ‚Äì and its 26 @CyberSolarium recommendations ‚Äì enacted into law. https://t.co/5wVtqjMEtT At ~8:15, I‚Äôll join @JohnBerman on @NewDay to discuss Congress‚Äôs push to pass bipartisan coronavirus relief legislation. Hope you can tune in! A pleasure to connect with folks from @MaineChamber today to discuss the challenges facing our state‚Äôs small businesses, and the bipartisan work being done in the Senate to help these community cornerstones survive the long winter ahead. https://t.co/VYY4DGNMNs There it is ‚Äî a light at the end of the tunnel. Thrilled to see this ray of hope, but we must remember that we‚Äôre not done with this pandemic yet. Please, keep taking precautions so we can protect our communities until the vaccine is widely available. https://t.co/v8AgWzptAN This legislation should be viewed as a starting point, to get us through the worst of the long winter ahead ‚Äì and in the next several months, Congress should continue negotiating in an effort to prepare additional relief legislation this coming spring. I support this measure because the American people are in desperate need of relief, and they don‚Äôt have time for months of Congressional haggling; they need action, now. Our agreement is far from perfect; however, we don‚Äôt have time to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. When you look at our initial framework, this final agreement isn‚Äôt a glass that‚Äôs half full ‚Äì this glass is eighty percent full. In addition, this legislation will strengthen our public health infrastructure as healthcare providers across the country prepare to deliver vaccine doses in the months ahead. This agreement extends unemployment benefits for workers who‚Äôve lost their jobs due to the pandemic‚Äôs economic impact, and provides another crucial lifeline for the nation‚Äôs small businesses. After weeks of negotiations marked by good-faith efforts on both sides of the aisle to strike a compromise, today we have reached an agreement that would provide hundreds of billions of dollars for Americans who are struggling. https://t.co/9pcEFX7iQV This year‚Äôs holiday season looks different for millions of Americans, as traditions change and families stay apart. These companies have an opportunity to encourage Americans to stay home ‚Äì slowing the virus‚Äôs spread ‚Äì and boost national spirits during this festive time of year."
"Klobuchar, Amy",SenAmyKlobuchar,AmyKlobuchar,Minnesota,Minnesota,Senator," Vanita Gupta is just who we need as our country‚Äôs next Associate Attorney General. A true civil rights champion, her leadership is crucial as we fight for equality and justice for all. Change won‚Äôt happen on its own ‚Äì so let‚Äôs #ConfirmGupta and get to work. To honor the life and memory of Daunte Wright ‚Äì and George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Philando Castile, and many others ‚Äì we must pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.

https://t.co/ICF2W51j8V There's no question: this pandemic has taken a toll on Americans' mental health.
 
@TimKaine &amp; I introduced legislation that will help us assess the scope of this mental health crisis &amp; take steps to promote recovery &amp; healing.
  
https://t.co/qU3CIZBb4k .@WhipClyburn and I know that in 2021, we should be able to bring high-speed internet to every family in America ‚Äî regardless of their zip code.

The impacts of this bold relief package will be felt by all Americans ‚Äì workers, students, parents &amp; children.
 
Now it's time to defeat this virus &amp; get our economy back on track. What do you think @SenMikeLee ‚Äì should I change my nameplate? https://t.co/C4G1G53Dp6 Our media outlets need a fighting chance when negotiating for fair treatment by the digital platforms where so many Americans consume their news.

I‚Äôm working with @davidcicilline to give them that chance. https://t.co/J7JxTCDeGC Today‚Äôs hearing made one thing crystal clear: if we want to see the rise of the next generation of great American companies, we need to reinvigorate our competition policy. https://t.co/FDjSz3TiGO Help is on the way.
 
Today @POTUS signed a relief package that will support parents and children, prioritize health and safety, and get our economy back on track. https://t.co/c2hYEBiJmg Our country faces a major monopoly power problem, and at tomorrow's hearing we will examine this problem‚Äôs scope and the reforms necessary to correct it to build a strong economy that works for all Americans.

Addressing the challenges facing our democracy will require both legislative and executive responses.

I will continue to be a steadfast partner in the fight to implement long-needed democracy reforms. https://t.co/Z03xgrX5nn Thank you @RoyBlunt for your service to the American people. For years, we've partnered to get things done -- on the Rules Committee, Joe Biden‚Äôs Inauguration, the Adoption Caucus, and more.

https://t.co/Hl2Vy0nUbF Justice Ginsburg‚Äôs dedication to our country‚Äôs values and ideals is an example for every American. The Capitol is our most recognizable symbol of Democracy -- let‚Äôs honor her life and service by establishing a monument in her honor.

https://t.co/qFE41U2q1J This bill will close a dangerous loophole &amp; stop abusive dating partners &amp; convicted stalkers from buying or owning a gun ‚Äì a common sense step that will save lives. 

It‚Äôs time to protect victims of abuse &amp; their families by passing this legislation. https://t.co/ryfVC09LkO In the end, it was left to frontline officers who were severely outnumbered to protect not only those of us in the Capitol, but our democracy itself. They performed heroically under unimaginable circumstances, suffering many injuries &amp; loss of life.

That‚Äôs why we need answers. https://t.co/VyChfptpKt As millions of workers seek to re-enter the workforce after becoming unemployed during the pandemic, we must help them access training and development programs that will position them for success.

https://t.co/ZhE0UbYbfW The fact that Americans pay more than people in other countries for the exact same medications is just wrong.

I will continue working to ensure Americans have more options when picking their medications, which will ultimately save consumers money.

https://t.co/Q9X6nsUdQ9 During an emergency, reliable communications networks save lives. I‚Äôm proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to establish strong communications pathways and provide regular updates to first responders so we can help those in need during crises.

https://t.co/3CAnrJjb9I On January 6th, Officer Eugene Goodman not only protected us from a violent mob ‚Äì he saved our Republic from an insurrection.

These are symptoms of ongoing &amp; deeply rooted inequities that we must confront.

https://t.co/3YVZX3zmZP In today‚Äôs hearing, we got answers to many key questions ‚Äî and those answers will help guide us to solutions. https://t.co/VZZCCYBJyV This pandemic has taken a toll on seniors and their caregivers, both emotionally and financially. My legislation will allow seniors to stay connected to their communities. 

https://t.co/fV3X1O62Wz Across the world, journalists keep citizens informed and government leaders accountable. We must ensure they are able to do their jobs without fear of harm.

https://t.co/IzAYktYt3t With a new year underway, one of my top priorities is addressing the unique risks facing rural Minnesotans and ensuring rural areas get the support they need.

https://t.co/0KLEHmVYy6 Parents shouldn‚Äôt be forced to decide between working to provide for their families and staying at home with their children. This legislation will help ensure that every family, including those in rural areas, is able to get the child care they need.
 
https://t.co/zz1vUrIKAn Without significant focus and attention on reopening schools, many systemic inequities in education could worsen. I look forward to working with the administration as it continues to help students and educators safely return to in-person learning.

https://t.co/AwsPBw4fDk While it‚Äôs great that new technologies have made it easier for people to monitor their own health, we must ensure there are regulations in place to protect consumers as new products that collect personal health information continue to enter the market. 

https://t.co/oRAFnz2Gxn The Conservation Reserve Program is key to supporting Minnesota producers &amp; landowners who ensure the health of our state‚Äôs water, soil, &amp; wildlife. I‚Äôm proud to continue supporting this important program to protect our state‚Äôs private lands.

The U.S. Attorney and U.S. Marshal are critical to keeping our state and communities safe. I am confident that this committee will find candidates who are committed to the promise of equal justice under the law for all.

https://t.co/4uuLA89iSu We can‚Äôt sweep antitrust concerns under the rug and hope our existing laws are adequate. This legislation is the first step to overhauling and modernizing them so we can promote competition and protect American consumers. https://t.co/LFVTNqcueJ Without significant focus and attention to women‚Äôs workforce issues at the federal level, the disproportionate economic impact of the pandemic on women threatens to harm our nation‚Äôs recovery and reverse decades of progress. https://t.co/XCSyJoQ3I6 I‚Äôve been privileged to call Denis a friend for years, and I know as the VA Secretary he will honor the promises our country has made to veterans and their families.

https://t.co/7HG4dnz90S Rep. Jim Ramstad was a true mentor to me on how to work with both Democrats and Republicans to get things done. Renaming the Wayzata post office in Jim‚Äôs name will allow Minnesotans to remember Jim for generations to come.

https://t.co/VdvmFwYcuK All Americans deserve safety and dignity, yet new fraudulent schemes designed to target seniors appear frequently. This bipartisan legislation will help protect seniors from fraud and prevent emergency-related scams in the future.

https://t.co/BmkIDSLfaG As we continue to battle this pandemic and advance a national vaccine strategy, it is vital that online platforms do not spread content that can harm the health of Americans.

https://t.co/Uf4ULuBZ4m Minnesota‚Äôs farmers and agriculture workers are critical in securing our state‚Äôs food supply. I‚Äôm glad help is on the way for many contract turkey growers, and I will continue to work across the aisle to get additional relief for those in need.

https://t.co/xd27mll3Zm Lengthy reviews of the ASCAP &amp; BMI consent decrees should be enough to conclude that leaving these decrees in place best serves competition. I urge the Biden Admin. to focus future reviews on other highly-concentrated industries to protect competition.

https://t.co/PO7mVqHN4X Google‚Äôs decision to close its acquisition of Fitbit while the transaction is under review is yet another sign of the company‚Äôs disregard for antitrust laws. I urge the DOJ to seek remedies to protect competition &amp; consumers from anticompetitive effects caused by the transaction. https://t.co/N9oWFpxJrK Restoring the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard is key to supporting Minnesota‚Äôs farmers &amp; the biofuels industry. I look forward to working with the Biden administration to protect our climate &amp; drive economic opportunity in America‚Äôs heartland.

https://t.co/t4mc8ptrz5 Consumers shouldn‚Äôt have to pay the price for Facebook‚Äôs insatiable appetite for user data. It is critical for Congress to pass comprehensive data privacy legislation, and until that happens, Facebook should reverse this misguided policy.

What is the administration going to do to stop this humanitarian crisis, close our borders and actually protect us against cartels?

This shouldn‚Äôt be controversial. https://t.co/WypXS10sC1 Dems skipped committees, wrote 600+ pages in the dark &amp; even they are now getting cold feet with some of the overspending in this bill.  Oklahomans deserve COVID relief, but not wasteful spending of their tax dollars. We‚Äôve been on the same vote since 11am even though all 100 senators have already voted. Dems are in complete disarray about how to proceed. further evidence that the bill is not ready. We can &amp; should work together on targeted relief.

Every dollar we spend is borrowed, from China or somewhere else. W/ over $1 trillion unspent from the last package we should identify where there is still a need &amp; how it will be spent before we borrow 1.9 trillion more dollars. https://t.co/TGCj7g4oCw The Senate is debating a $1.9 trillion package. Five times before, Congress has come together to pass $4T+ in bipartisan relief.

Rather than working with Republicans on targeted relief, Dems are pushing through a trillion dollar partisan relief package.
https://t.co/ieg0SRDnA3 You can listen to the reading of the 682-page bill at https://t.co/t9AOJXdVpN 2:35pm-voted to proceed to a bill w/a price tag of $1.9T before we even got the text. W/every dollar of $1.9T borrowed from China or somewhere else, we should be able to read the bill &amp; know what‚Äôs unspent over from the $1 trillion we approved in December. https://t.co/9p3WZ2vZHf The Biden Administration should expand sanctions beyond military leaders &amp; help bolster firewall circumvention in Burma. We stand with the people of Burma in their call for a free, open society. The ongoing events in Burma are absolutely appalling.

This impeachment trial is clearly unconstitutional. The Constitution is clear that ""judgement in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office.‚Äù (Article I, Section 3, Clause 7). You cannot vote to remove someone from office who is not even in office. This is nonsense and sets a terrible precedent for the future.

Scott, Rep. Welch And Others -- https://t.co/oBSYVsGBth For the world‚Äôs most powerful military ‚Äì our own -- to claim it needs anti-personnel #landmines, a barbaric, indiscriminate weapon that 164 nations have banned, shocks the conscience. We are better than this. See my statement TODAY: https://t.co/QH5pbFdGjg https://t.co/sDWNVxxiZh Today on Mine Awareness Day we remember the victims of #landmines, which indiscriminately maim and kill the innocent as well as our own troops. 164 nations have joined to ban them, but we have not. The US should lead by our example, not by our failure to act. April 3rd is 2000 days that American hostage Siamak Namazi has suffered in Iran‚Äôs Evin Prison. His father, Baquer, is struggling to survive, unable to get medical care due to a travel ban. The US &amp; intl community must end Iran‚Äôs hostage diplomacy once &amp; for all. #FreeTheNamazis And it was encouraging to hear Gov Scott and VTrans indicate that an announcement is coming soon on a resumption of #Amtrak service in the state.¬†These services are an important part of our transportation network, connecting our communities to each other and the region. .@POTUS &amp; #Amtrak have put forward a clear vision of how the American Jobs Plan can make significant improvements to our passenger rail network. ¬†I‚Äôll be working closely with them to further improve VT‚Äôs rail lines as part of this process. #AJP My 2016 #preclearance legislation set the table for extending the Vermonter to #MTL &amp; I look forward to working with Pres. Biden, @Amtrak &amp; Canadian officials to finally restore that service. Connecting #VT &amp; Montreal by rail will offer an important boost to Vermont‚Äôs economy. On the #Appropriations Committee I‚Äôve always made #Amtrak a funding priority. We also secured Obama-era ARRA funds to make major investments in the #Vermonter route to increase its speeds. These prior federal investments make the #VT expansions Amtrak has laid out possible. There‚Äôs much to love about @Amtrak‚Äôs proposed new service map. Over the past decade I worked in the #Appropriations Committee to secure millions of dollars to extend the Ethan Allen from Rutland to #BTV. The construction work making that expansion will be completed this year. https://t.co/dbzIojMekl I commend Sec Blinken for ending sanctions against the ICC prosecutors. ¬†We may disagree with some of their decisions, but Trump‚Äôs spiteful attack against them was unworthy of the US.

The facility is designed to handle no more than 1,000 people and with current COVID safety guidelines, that number drops to 250 people. 2/2 Cartels are making millions of dollars per week. Our Border Patrol agents are overwhelmed.

Sadly, it was blocked by Senate Democrats.  https://t.co/TpsD56jLHa Earmarks let politicians funnel your money to their campaign donors as payoff.

Simply spending more federal government money, however, will not address those problems. https://t.co/CL8hVdhzsh Sen.

The ability of Utahns to exercise their constitutional rights and liberties should always be promoted and defended. Your support of the 2nd amendment is commendable. @utahsenate @utahhousereps Incredible work being done by 40 incredible Utahns. A state is only as good as the people who call it home. With men and women like these, it‚Äôs no wonder that Utah continues to grow and thrive. https://t.co/06ejFAjNi8 Thank you, Gideon George, for sharing your journey. You are truly an inspiration, and we are lucky to have you as part of our Utah story.

His reward for trying to turn down the temperature was to be lied about and disparaged by liberal media outlets such as The Daily Beast, Business Insider, and The New York Times.‚Äù 1/2 ‚ÄúThere can be no question that he was talking about the three Democrat politicians whose violent rhetoric had just been aired. ..."" https://t.co/gbM2Zg3M9m I suggested we all take responsibility for lowering the temperature of our politics, and look for opportunities to seek to forgive overheated speeches rather than avenge them.

Fox News teed up an opportunity for me to slam Democrats‚Äô inflammatory rhetoric, and I declined to do so. 2/3 For those who are accusing me of giving Trump a ‚Äúmulligan‚Äù because of a headline manufactured for more clicks ‚Äì watch this clip. 1/3 https://t.co/bot4Cco2yx To be perfectly clear, my reference to taking a ‚Äúmulligan‚Äù was not referring to Trump, but to Democratic politicians whose inflammatory comments had just been played for me on the air.

I am proud to have led the Yemen War Powers resolution with @BernieSanders for the last 4 years and today is a victory for restoring the war-making power to the legislative branch. We need to localize more decisions so that all Americans, regardless of where they live, can live under policies that they are more likely to agree with. That's the beauty of federalism. That is the goal of the budget resolution amendments that I will be introducing this week. https://t.co/aVy3NjF2kk The whole point of American foreign aid is to assist countries in times of need...

The Project just released 3 reports highlighting the opioid epidemic, school reopenings, and child care costs.

But our current tax code strays from that neutrality.

Today we honor Officer Sicknick who died in that fight. He is a hero and we will never forget his sacrifice.

https://t.co/QFy0atS1kw The combination of Mr. Mayorkas‚Äôs expansive view of unlimited executive power coupled with his established track record of favoritism for partisan allies makes him a very dangerous choice to head the Department of Homeland Security for the American people. https://t.co/Qdi8lcAqLg Great work by our @JECRepublicans staff on the very real costs of distance learning.

It is imperative that we ensure markets work for consumers, not just monopolists. It is equally imperative that we not cede this task to the radical left. The consumer welfare standard is essential to both. 5/5 We need the enforcers to (finally) enforce the antitrust laws against those who harm competition and consumers, including Big Tech. But we need to do it in a way that doesn't allow judges to usurp Congress's legislative role. 4/5 Let's also note what the consumer welfare standard is NOT: it is not a narrow concern with price. As Judge Bork wrote, it encompasses ‚Äúinnovation, choice among differing products"" and quality. That more than covers the ways in which markets like Big Tech are failing us. 3/5 What is the consumer welfare standard? It's a guardrail that ensures 1) the primary beneficiaries of the antitrust laws are the people, not big business; and 2) that unelected judges are not allowed to use antitrust to advance their own political preferences. 2/5 There‚Äôs a lot of talk about antitrust legislation this Congress. One thing lost in many proposed reforms: the consumer welfare standard is not a get-out-of-jail-free card for Big Tech. We don‚Äôt need to change the law, we need to enforce it. 1/5 I‚Äôd otherwise share this on Parler too, but .... How many times will Big Tech companies disprove their own claims of having given the world useful, valuable services? This is what happens when competition is stifled. https://t.co/CvvjlWHIjf We should investigate. https://t.co/1CRvL4fLs5 The text thus reveals that the authors of the Constitution chose a design that was different than the English impeachment system, under which any private citizen could be impeached.

Let‚Äôs get to work and deliver on these much-needed priorities. The American Jobs Plan will empower New Mexicans to Build Back Better.

There is no greater return on investment than when we invest in our people ‚Äì and that‚Äôs what the American Jobs Plan will do by investing in infrastructure and creating new jobs. C√©sar Ch√°vez spent his life fighting for the labor movement and equal rights for all. #CesarChavezDay is an important reminder that the fight for justice, equality, and dignity is not over ‚Äì and it‚Äôs a fight we must continue today. https://t.co/ip1hiZYWWd This week, President Biden signed the PPP Extension Act to extend the application deadline to May 31. I‚Äôm proud to have voted for this extension, and I encourage New Mexico small businesses to apply for these benefits available to them. https://t.co/mI4hLCS8e1 Every American deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. That's why I‚Äôm committed to passing the #EqualityAct to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. On #TransVisibilityDay, we celebrate the achievements and contributions of transgender Americans to our nation - from our Armed Forces to the leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services. As the first Hispanic Senator to represent New Mexico in more than 40 years, I‚Äôm standing on the shoulders of giants who came before me. 

The challenges that New Mexico faces are great. But there's nothing we can't get through together. https://t.co/HqYDtHBQwF New Mexicans impacted by the pandemic can now access additional help with rent and utilities. I was proud to have voted for this critical federal investment as part of the December COVID-19 relief bill. https://t.co/y8p4tJMzmW After a years-long battle with the USDA under the Trump administration, I was proud to join Rio Arriba farmers and ranchers this afternoon to celebrate the USDA‚Äôs commitment to reimburse farmers and ranchers and continue covering drought claims on acequia-irrigated lands. https://t.co/ow1Yvf8cBE On this 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, our country honors those who served with distinction and bravery.

Great catching up with @JessicaASmith8 &amp; @KristinReports on how to get this done.
https://t.co/yth53VWwYj Honored to meet with leaders from the Four Corners Economic Development to discuss our continued partnership to bring more business to our state.

I'm glad that the Biden administration is working with me to ensure that USDA provides equitable relief for New Mexicans and puts an end to these unfair actions. This reversal in policy and practice represents a hard-fought victory that gives New Mexicans the benefits they deserve and have paid into, as well as a chance to keep their farms and ranches afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drought relief is on the way for New Mexicans. Major victory: The USDA has agreed to fully compensate Rio Arriba farmers &amp; ranchers for unfair changes made to the NAP reimbursement rate, and the USDA is pausing a policy change that would have stopped covering drought claims on acequia-irrigated lands.

Yet, many of New Mexico‚Äôs Tribal and rural communities lack reliable access to high-speed internet. My new bill would allow local governments and internet providers to expand broadband connectivity to these areas. Students in rural and Tribal communities know the difference between fast internet, slow internet, and no internet. This new legislation would put WiFi on school buses to allow students with long commutes to access the internet while going to and from school. Last week, I introduced my first bills as a U.S. Senator. This pair of bills would help bridge the #DigitalDivide and tackle the #HomeworkGap by using innovative solutions to expand broadband connectivity across New Mexico and the country. https://t.co/PaKQT3FTK6 I‚Äôll be on Facebook Live this evening at 7 p.m. MT to discuss the #AmericanRescuePlan and how this landmark legislation benefits New Mexicans.

I was honored to speak with @GovMLG, @MartinHeinrich, and @RepTeresaLF to highlight how our state benefits from this new law. https://t.co/sYzHOGYqJL Pleased to see that President Biden has just signed the American Rescue Plan. This historic legislation will help get vaccine shots into the arms of New Mexicans and provide them with the support they need to recover and rebuild. https://t.co/zg29URwdQX The House just passed the American Rescue Plan, which means that critical COVID relief is on its way to the President's desk.

This historic legislation will empower New Mexicans to recover and rebuild. 

https://t.co/dpzkt0WMpa The American Rescue Plan will help get more vaccine shots into the arms of New Mexicans, revive our economy, and save lives and livelihoods ‚Äì and now it‚Äôs one step closer toward becoming law. Families in New Mexico need relief to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. The American Rescue Plan expands the Child Tax Credit, slashes child poverty, and puts money back in New Mexicans‚Äô pocketbooks.
 
This is a win for families. With New Mexicans still struggling one year after COVID-19 reached our state, the U.S. Senate has PASSED the American Rescue Plan.
 
‚úîÔ∏è $1,400 direct payments
‚úîÔ∏è More dollars for vaccine distribution
‚úîÔ∏è Relief for small businesses
‚úîÔ∏èRobust support for New Mexico's communities https://t.co/p0WlsBVb30 The Senate has been voting through the night and into the morning to move forward the American Rescue Plan. 

I‚Äôm still on the floor voting, and I‚Äôm still fighting to deliver the relief that New Mexicans need. This report underscores the urgency of passing the American Rescue Plan to boost our economy, get more vaccine shots into the arms of Americans, and empower New Mexicans to Build Back Better. The February jobs report marks progress toward getting our economy growing again in the right direction, but more work remains to address the economic uncertainty facing American families and help small businesses and mom-and-pop shops recover and rebuild. https://t.co/XylTz6GFCq These are just a few of the measures that will make a difference in New Mexicans lives. I‚Äôm proud to support this bill, and I look forward to seeing the American Rescue Plan one step closer toward becoming law. The American Rescue Plan supports New Mexico‚Äôs hardest hit small businesses by providing an additional $7 billion for PPP loans and $15 billion for EIDL loans, and creating a $25 billion fund for restaurant owners. For struggling New Mexico families, the relief package includes $1,400 direct payments and enhanced unemployment benefits. It also includes an expansion of the Child Tax Credit, which would lift 32,000 New Mexico children out of poverty and halve our state child poverty rate. I‚Äôm voting for the American Rescue Plan because it strengthens America‚Äôs response to COVID-19 and provides urgently needed relief for New Mexico‚Äôs families and small businesses. Here‚Äôs how this plan benefits New Mexico: Saddened to hear that New Mexico has lost a legislative giant. For nearly 40 years, Ed Sandoval was a dedicated public servant who worked tirelessly to improve our state. New Mexico will miss his leadership dearly, and I will keep his family in my prayers. https://t.co/shuybaZRnF This is welcome news: almost a quarter of New Mexicans have received at least their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 

Passing the American Rescue Plan will help us build on this success and get more vaccines into the arms of New Mexicans. https://t.co/XD1UcTsQhs Great meeting with Polly Trottenberg, the nominee for @USDOT Deputy Secretary, to ensure that the needs of New Mexicans are met.

The American Rescue Plan also expands the Child Tax Credit, which will lift 32,000 New Mexican children out of poverty and cuts our state childhood poverty rate in HALF.

New Mexico and our country need this bill to pass. @SenOssoff, are you in? https://t.co/Y0hc8k5BIq The truth is out there. üõ∏

I upheld that oath today, and I will continue to honor the trust that New Mexicans have placed in me. I took no pleasure in voting to convict President Trump for inciting an insurrection against the U.S. government. However, there is no doubt that the former president did everything in his power to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Officer Eugene Goodman saved lives on January 6th, and senators owe him a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid. 

Tonight, I was proud to see the Senate come together to give him a standing ovation and vote to award him with the Congressional Gold Medal. https://t.co/LhWy49NUja Went to the steps of the Capitol to share my thoughts on the impeachment trial. 

President Trump used every tool at his disposal to overturn the election results ‚Äî and it led to a violent attack on our democracy. 

The Senate must convict to ensure this never happens again. https://t.co/7CEctcnay6 This is welcome news! With more vaccines coming, I‚Äôm glad to see the Navajo Nation is already off to a great start.

I will continue working to ensure New Mexico‚Äôs Tribal Nations and Pueblos have access to these safe and effective vaccines. https://t.co/rzh00kqs0w Never-before-seen footage from Capitol security cameras showed just how close senators and congressional staff came to dangerous rioters. 

We owe our brave Capitol Police officers a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid. https://t.co/jdToQPFlPl Today, House impeachment managers laid out a powerful case showing how President Trump's words and actions incited a violent mob to attack the U.S. Capitol. 

As @RepRaskin put it, ""If that is not an impeachable offense, then there is no such thing."" https://t.co/u62hRqgRvP This #BlackHistoryMonth, New Mexico honors the deep roots of Black Americans in our state dating back to 1539. Black Americans have enriched New Mexico‚Äôs culture and community, and this month, we celebrate this legacy and ensure it‚Äôs protected. https://t.co/hYIbzpWbQ8 The video that impeachment managers showed as part of their opening statement was compelling. To see, again, the danger that threatened everyone in the Capitol and the bravery of Officer Goodman and Capitol Police, it took me back to that tragic day.    
 
This is a must-watch. https://t.co/H7hYJAKvkr The VA must make it a priority to fulfill America‚Äôs promise to our veterans, and that includes administering the COVID-19 vaccine to as many vets as possible and providing support for those struggling.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm joining @SenSchumer and @SenWarren in urging @POTUS to #CancelStudentDebt to alleviate this burden and help Americans regain control over their financial futures.

Let‚Äôs get this done. A month after the Capitol insurrection, I still remember the violent sounds and dramatic scenes from that day. Lawmakers, journalists, and staff were put in harm's way because of President Trump‚Äôs lies. Watch my interview with @TheSundayShow where I give my account. https://t.co/gP0b7OKyE5 This #SuperBowl Sunday, let‚Äôs make sure to celebrate safely.

My prayers go out to their families, friends, and brothers and sisters in service. Officer Brian Sicknick will be remembered as an American hero. Today, the American people pay tribute to his life as he lies in honor in the Capitol Rotunda ‚Äì a symbol of our democracy that he gave his life to protect. https://t.co/Ez4m9wtplx I urge further action by Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform that is tough and fair and recognizes the contributions of immigrants to the American dream. The actions taken today by President Biden are the first steps toward repairing the harm done to immigrant and refugee families under the last administration. I applaud President Biden for taking these necessary and urgent actions. https://t.co/rP1pLjoBc4 On these committees, I‚Äôll be focused on combating COVID-19, strengthening health care and nutrition assistance, making strong investments in education and infrastructure, creating opportunities and new jobs, and honoring America‚Äôs trust responsibilities to Tribal Nations.

Under my bill, the Grizzly Bear State Management Act, wildlife scientists in the state would be able to make science-driven decisions on how to best manage the Yellowstone grizzly population and help Grizzly 399 do just that. https://t.co/pg1A9xUhRt I come ‚Äúbear‚Äùing good news: The grizzly bear population around Yellowstone has recovered! So it‚Äôs time they are removed from the Endangered Species list. We need to let science, not feelings, dictate our grizzly bear policy. #bearswithoutbureaucracy

https://t.co/iwSi7QLgtQ Question. What kind of bear is best? Well, there‚Äôs two schools of thought. I‚Äôd say a bear that‚Äôs part of a well-managed population &amp; not subject to the whims of judges and environmentalists. That‚Äôs why I introduced the Grizzly Bear State Management Act. #bearswithoutbureaucracy https://t.co/xaYEBI0YOz .@federalreserve Chairman Powell is right.

https://t.co/Y17PQOJu4n This is the largest surge in migration in two decades, yet the Biden Admin refuses to call it a crisis.

Haaland will make this more difficult, but I‚Äôll keep fighting for our Wyoming way of life, no matter what. The University of Wyoming (#gopokes) is the only 4-year public university in Wyoming. Under the #BidenBan, Wyoming stands to lose nearly $13 billion in tax revenue. That‚Äôs enough to fund UW for the next 59 years. .@GovernorGordon got it right. It‚Äôs foolish to think cancelling this pipeline will do anything to help our economy or our climate. I‚Äôm glad Wyoming is signing on to this lawsuit to signal to President Biden that this is the wrong move for our country.

https://t.co/21IHwI0tD2 Wyoming dedicates a third of our biennial budget to healthcare in Wyoming. Under the #BidenBan, Wyoming stands to lose nearly $13 billion in tax revenue. That‚Äôs enough to fund the WY Dept of Health for the next 26 years.

https://t.co/Rkhem4YpnF Becerra fails to represent the pro-life, pro-religious liberty values we in WY hold dear. This combined w/ his lack of healthcare experience and support for Obamacare, which has left WY businesses reeling &amp; many WY citizens w/o coverage, makes him the wrong choice for as HHS Sec. Mary Bellamy made history as the first woman legislator in Wyoming. She served one two-year term. #womenshistorymonth https://t.co/E6QBU4XdCO Wyoming dedicates 24% of its budget to education. Wyoming spends over $16,000/student. Under Biden‚Äôs EO, WY could lose almost $13 billion in tax revenue. That‚Äôs enough to educate 60,000 WY students for their entire K-12 education. If the #BidenBan stands, students lose. I‚Äôm honored to serve as ranking member on the Subcommittee for Fisheries, Wildlife, and Water.

#GoWyo https://t.co/P9LvJUCF68 In her nomination hearing, Deb Haaland said ‚Äúwe absolutely need energy independence‚Ä¶‚Äù but her past statements and actions are diametrically opposed to that very goal. I have zero faith that she will fight for American energy. If we‚Äôre going to Build Back Better, we need to streamline the permitting process. Projects sit in limbo for months or years while we wait for frivolous lawsuits to run their course. I talked about this in committee today, and hope we prioritize this as we move forward. https://t.co/SF9U0dKyC2 Kentucky families are on the menu. Wyoming families are on the menu.

Swain made history by becoming the first woman in the world to legally cast a vote. She did this in the Equality State, my state of WY. #womenshistorymonth We‚Äôre a year into the pandemic.

https://t.co/2OvQigNFPv Wyoming is the largest net exporter of energy in the U.S. 
We produce 15x the amount of energy we consume. 

We produce the most natural gas from federal leases in the nation. 

Deb Haaland at Interior won‚Äôt just put Wyoming at risk, but American energy independence.

https://t.co/H3RJytlVxz

@taxreformer Rep Haaland‚Äôs Record = Bad for WY, Families &amp; National Security. Our energy independence is a nat'l sec. issue. States like WY drive our energy independence. Policies like those advocated for by Rep Haaland will give foreign countries an advantage over American energy producers. President Biden‚Äôs actions on Paris are short-sighted, and I‚Äôm proud to work with @SteveDaines and @MarshaBlackburn to try and stop them. This treaty fails to hold polluting countries accountable and instead punishes American workers, particularly those in WY and other energy producing states. (2/3) President Biden has again ignored the Senate‚Äôs Constitutional duty to advise and consent, unilaterally forcing America back into the Paris climate treaty.

Officer William ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù Evans was a true American hero who gave everything defending his country and the sacred institution of democracy. All of us in Congress - members and staff - are forever grateful for Officer Evans‚Äôs service and sacrifice. Southeast Asian Americans came here to escape decades of war, genocide, and instability.

As Congress debates an annual budget, I will work with my colleagues and the Biden administration to make smart, substantial cuts to the Pentagon budget. President Biden wants $715 billion for the Dept. of Defense, a 1.5% increase over last year. The already inflated Pentagon budget did nothing to protect us from a global pandemic, an economic recession, or the climate crisis. Increasing that budget now would be a grave mistake. The warning is clear from the scientists at @WoodwellClimate. If we are going to stop the climate from irreversibly warming, we have to urgently cut fossil fuel emissions. To do that, we must pass a Green New Deal. https://t.co/jrs7bkYUWJ Pleased to see my friend @ClimateEnvoy John Kerry meet with @PMOIndia this week.

Good luck to @CoachCarvelUM and @UMassHockey. https://t.co/RzlFpZbUmp President Biden‚Äôs executive actions on gun violence are a good first step to achieving the commonsense reforms that Americans overwhelmingly support. But the Senate must act and pass reforms like universal background checks. Every day @SenateGOP blocks these bills costs lives. Republicans who don't understand solar energy and storage just need to listen to The Temptations and visit the Mount Tom solar farm. https://t.co/cssg8aoqf7 The beautiful campus of @mtholyoke is one of my favorite places.

https://t.co/EnEjb9m1an Indigenous communities have been excelling in their vaccination efforts and the Mashpee Wampanoag in Massachusetts are no exception.

This is why the Weymouth compressor station needs to be shut down immediately. It‚Äôs a threat to public safety, to environmental justice, and to the climate. https://t.co/gubcs5FNhI I'm grateful for the health care heroes at the McCoy vaccination center in New Bedford who are working day after day to return our communities to health. https://t.co/ZotpLYASEC I‚Äôm in New Bedford at the McCoy vaccination center with my friend Mayor Mitchell and the frontline health care heroes who are working to finally defeat this public health crisis: https://t.co/5BTtOYkZHm It is only right that Officer Evans lay in honor in the building he gave his life defending. We can never repay the debt we owe him for protecting the Capitol, but his heroic sacrifice deserves a heroic tribute. And his family deserves to see how grateful our nation is. https://t.co/vmbe1XLEkD An exciting day ahead on the South Coast and the Cape. Stopping by a vaccination clinic in New Bedford, visiting with the Mashpee Wampanoag to learn about the Tribe‚Äôs incredible vaccination efforts, and ending the day at @WoodwellClimate to discuss the Center‚Äôs latest research. The Weymouth natural gas compressor station is a microcosm of environmental injustice. The health and safety of communities on one side, the profits of faraway corporations on the other. https://t.co/79cGXLLiTw There's growing research that apps like Instagram may be detrimental to kids‚Äô mental health, and they are online more than ever because of the pandemic.

Today I‚Äôll be meeting with my friends at the Bean Counter Bakery in Shrewsbury, standing in solidarity with @MassNurses on strike in Worcester, and visiting Polar Park, the soon-to-be-home of the @WooSox. Wishing a happy, healthy, and safe #Passover to family and friends celebrating in Massachusetts and around the world. We have your back, @Cannonfor58. Your courage will give us all strength in the fight to defend the sacred right to vote. Thank you. Georgia criminalized giving water to voters and arrested a State Rep for knocking on a door. This isn't about ‚Äúvoter fraud.‚Äù This is about oppressing Black and Brown people.

Republican attacks on voting rights must be fought and defeated in Georgia, in the Senate, everywhere. https://t.co/aKv6AhZsFg The Trump rollback of the methane rule was almost universally condemned because it jeopardized our health, our climate, and our economy.

 https://t.co/zl2DVVDXau As the number of globally displaced persons reaches an all time high, we must not let U.S. refugee admissions remain at an all time low. We must say loudly and clearly that refugees are welcome. https://t.co/O3YqmMAIyG With the number of displaced peoples and refugees in the millions and steadily climbing, the US must admit more than 15,000 people in a given year and fulfill our moral responsibility to the global community. https://t.co/l08wsCWTzV We must drastically increase the number of refugees entering the United States in order to match the scale of the global displacement crisis. The Senate should pass my GRACE Act and make it absolutely clear that refugees are welcome here. https://t.co/vS4xVw3eRX The intersectionality of the climate crisis is undeniable as we watch redlined communities become frontline communities.

Let's prioritize spending that saves lives, rather than ends them.
https://t.co/2D8GJDXQZv Georgia is 1 of 43 states moving to restrict your right to vote.

Want to know what will stop them? The Senate passing voting rights legislation.

Do you know what‚Äôs stopping the Senate? The filibuster. 

A Jim Crow relic shouldn't stand between you and your right to vote. Throughout my career, I‚Äôve seen how oil and gas executives cozy up to authoritarian leaders. We should look into every avenue of cutting off the revenues of the Burmese military, while minimizing unintended harm to the people of Burma. It‚Äôs time for the U.S. to lead the world and ensure that our continued reliance on fossil fuels does not prop up the murderous regime in Burma. I'm calling on the Biden administration and international community to cut off the junta‚Äôs oil and gas revenues.
https://t.co/dpz0yoHD5R In response, the Biden administration has acted boldly and has rallied other like-minded countries to impose targeted sanctions on those who carried out the February 1st coup. 

But more must be done. The brutal acts of the junta, since its February 1st coup, is contrasted to the bravery of the civil disobedience movement in Burma. Hundreds of peaceful protesters have paid the ultimate price in defense of democracy and thousands more have been thrown behind bars. Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard from witnesses who shared our determination that the military junta‚Äôs violent assault on Burma‚Äôs fledgling democracy will not succeed. https://t.co/BjJeQvawmx We‚Äôre facing a plastic pollution crisis, and the impacts on Americans‚Äô health, particularly in communities of color and low-income communities, are serious.

We are in the midst of a historic, global refugee crisis. 

The GRACE Act will recommit the U.S. as a beacon of hope to those fleeing violence and persecution, and prevent a U.S. President from setting annual refugee admissions at a level below 125,000.
https://t.co/9r4VdEkuq9 In states all across the country, right-wing Republicans are trying to suppress the right to vote and targeting communities of color. The filibuster is critical to their strategy, just like it was in the 1960s against the Civil Rights Movement. We must abolish the filibuster. Latinas will not receive equal pay until October 21.

The USPS should not be run by someone who is determined to undermine its mission. These austerity measures are designed to suffocate America's most trusted institution, not save it.

Gun reform has vast support across America. The movement beat back the NRA. The House passed background checks with Republican votes. 

But the filibuster allows the minority to essentially veto it in the Senate.

That's not how a democracy functions, that's how a democracy dies. It's time for a union leader to run the Department of Labor. Marty Walsh isn't just an ally of organized labor, he's a fellow worker and organizer who understands the struggle and the power of working Americans.

Here's my @CJOnline op-ed: https://t.co/3aII7Um9rS With üá®üá≥ Phase 1 Deal, üáØüáµ Free Trade Agreement &amp; the üá∫üá∏-üá≤üáΩ-üá®üá¶ Agreement, we‚Äôve modernized nearly 50% of our export markets.

We are not applying to the same rules at the border as we are the rest of the country when it comes to COVID. https://t.co/qiIZpm9N1s I wrote about this in my @WSJopinion piece last week saying that applied science would suggest we could save tens of thousands of lives if we give one shot to as many people as possible and came back for a second dose as more vaccines are available. https://t.co/bdvGFJJNOq @nytimes: So far, the data suggest that Britain‚Äôs approach is working...daily number of new Covid cases has fallen by more than 90 percent since peaking in early January. The decline is larger than in virtually any other country‚Ä¶British deaths have also plummeted in recent weeks https://t.co/o9SYXZgFD6 Britain proves one shot approach will save TENS of thousands of lives. @US_FDA must be allowed to apply this real world science. https://t.co/sviS6tejD4 When good becomes too good. 
We‚Äôve sold so much ü•©--&gt;üáØüáµ that we tripped a ‚Äúsafeguard trigger‚Äù designed to protect Japanese producers by a short 30 day tariff increase. 
Perhaps we can negotiate that down too? https://t.co/DBNtSzkIRN Go Shocks! https://t.co/c0HkYaWvYe Completely hypocritical of Dr. Fauci to lock us down, lecture us to wear multiple masks, stay 6 feet apart &amp; stay away from family and friends but yet have no input on the border crisis where we have masses of illegal immigrants flooding into our nation, including many w/ COVID. https://t.co/gZsTaGpMUW President Biden‚Äôs requirements for his @HHSGov Secretary:

This crisis is our biggest, most immediate national security threat. Amidst the COVID-19 battle this has now turned into a public health crisis as well. Saw firsthand the amazing work being done at the Leavenworth VA Medical Center to vaccinate our Kansas heroes. As of yesterday, VA Eastern Kansas has provided over 17,000 doses for Vets and Staff. https://t.co/0Ju76B3fMz Migrant families coming across the border are testing positive for the coronavirus at between three and 10 times the rate of the U.S. population, according to a @WashTimes survey of jurisdictions that are doing the testing. 
Unacceptable!
https://t.co/mgysL2Z95K Great to see everyone in Atchison today for our town hall. Here is a good rundown of what we discussed via the @AtchisonGlobe: https://t.co/aBiYLek9qN The longer it takes Kansas to close this gap, the farther we are from herd immunity. Must involve our community pharmacists, doctor's offices, and local health departments more ‚Äì they have been the backbone of vaccinations for decades and can do this. https://t.co/SGsOfDKmHh Heading to southern border Sunday to tour along the Rio Grande River + get a briefing on growing population of migrants.

With COVID, it's a public health crisis as well https://t.co/Tp0Mvv5Woo One of my favorite parts of the job is getting out and talking to Kansans about the issue that matter to them the most. Great discussion so far at our town hall meeting in Atchison. So many topics to cover. https://t.co/WIPIb7SxLV Met with Atchison community leaders this morning to discuss everything from energy rates¬†to the Equality Act, and general business issues facing Kansans. https://t.co/x4uFVkBIxY Looking forward to my visit to Leavenworth @DeptVetAffairs later today to learn more about vaccination efforts including their use of the new Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. https://t.co/JE7VufXiEN My daughter sent me this comic from the FAMILY CIRCUS earlier this week.

"McConnell, Mitch",LeaderMcConnell,,Kentucky,Kentucky,Senator," Proud to introduce the CAROL Act today, alongside @SenatorSinema, one of @RepAndyBarr‚Äôs friends. This important legislation is a fitting tribute to a wonderful Kentuckian. It embodies Carol‚Äôs lifetime of service to others. I look forward to its passage. Democrats keep showing they don‚Äôt care about norms and institutions, only power. The latest example: a bill to pack the Supreme Court and destroy its legitimacy to guarantee the rulings liberals want. H.R.1 isn‚Äôt about justice, equality, or responding to recent state laws. It‚Äôs a recycled recipe for a massive Democrat takeover that they‚Äôve been pushing under changing justifications for multiple years. Read the bill. https://t.co/vCvDemQTym The Washington Post has given the WH its worst rating, Four Pinocchios, for repeated lies about election law. 
 
Democrats want to create a national controversy over voting regulations. But facts keep getting in their way. There is a bipartisan appetite for smart infrastructure bills. In fact, all the multi-year highway bills have been bipartisan going back decades.

There isn‚Äôt an appetite for using the word ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù to justify a multi-trillion-dollar slush fund for unrelated bad ideas. Foreign terrorists will not leave the U.S. alone simply because our politicians have grown tired of taking the fight to them. The President needs to explain to the American people how abandoning our partners and retreating in the face of the Taliban will make America safer. Officer Billy Evans died defending this Capitol, its institutions, and the thousands of people who work here. Today the Senate and the entire country are holding Officer Evans and his family in our thoughts and prayers. His sacrifice will not be forgotten. This new court-packing commission is not some serious pivot away from Democrats‚Äô political attacks on the Court. It‚Äôs just an attempt to clothe those attacks in fake legitimacy.

My full statement: https://t.co/qX639r68M3 Talk is cheap, but defending our country is not. We can't afford to fail in our constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense. Both parties should be able to agree that we must maintain America‚Äôs edge over China.

Our joint statement: https://t.co/7BHXvBBIvB Democrats‚Äô ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù proposal goes way beyond what working Americans would call infrastructure. It tries to use a bipartisan issue as a Trojan horse for tax hikes and miscellaneous liberal policies. 

We need to tackle infrastructure in a more targeted way. https://t.co/GWlADEG2SD Our private sector must stop taking cues from the Outrage-Industrial Complex. Americans do not need or want big business to amplify disinformation or react to every manufactured controversy with frantic left-wing signaling. My full statement: https://t.co/3Ck3qW4Mbe May you and your family have a blessed and joyful Easter Sunday. I am heartbroken that Officer Evans was killed today in the line of duty. On this Good Friday, let's all pray for healing for the surviving officer, comfort for Officer Evans‚Äôs family, and for all the officers and families of the United States Capitol Police.
¬†
My full statement: https://t.co/0ykpCLaoJX Praying for the United States Capitol Police officers who were attacked at the Capitol. We are still learning what‚Äôs taken place. Grateful to all the USCP and first responders who are on the scene. The latest news from Hong Kong only confirms Beijing‚Äôs tightening totalitarian grip over the formerly autonomous region. It is essential the Biden Administration work with like-minded partners to impose meaningful international consequences. My full statement: https://t.co/Liz39tDXS8 My advice to the Administration: If you want to do an infrastructure bill, let's do an infrastructure bill.

Before the pandemic, we had the best economy in 50 years. We should not raise taxes under the guise of an infrastructure bill and send our economy in the wrong direction. https://t.co/QFcHmP7GQI The Administration‚Äôs non-infrastructure ‚Äúinfrastructure bill‚Äù looks like another Trojan horse for far-left demands. Rolling back Right to Work laws. Imposing the biggest new tax hikes in a generation ‚Äî killing jobs and slowing wage growth when workers need a fast recovery. There would be bipartisan support for a serious, targeted infrastructure plan. Unfortunately, less than 6% of this massive White House proposal would go to roads and bridges. It would spend more on electric cars than on roads, bridges, ports, airports, and waterways combined. https://t.co/WjIvBSwpsg It‚Äôs a modern medical miracle that three safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines were produced in less than one year. Thanks to hardworking Kentuckians at the McKesson facility in Shepherdsville, those vaccines are being distributed all across the country. https://t.co/JZIxcWxJBu The border crisis is not just seasonal. CBP is tracking the largest surge in apprehensions in 20 years. Unaccompanied children are piling up in close quarters.
 
It turns out when politicians spend a two-year campaign advertising a porous border and amnesty, people listen. Democrats‚Äô attempted elections takeover has state and local officials sounding alarms. They say its unworkable provisions would invite total chaos in our elections. Even Democratic officials.

No wonder Democrats want to talk about everything except what's actually in their bill. https://t.co/8IL3M1Z1Ie Democrats' H.R. 1 would leave elections more vulnerable to cheating, send taxpayer dollars to subsidize campaigns, and would turn the bipartisan Federal Election Commission into a Democrat-controlled partisan body.

It‚Äôs not about protecting voting. It‚Äôs about rigging the system. https://t.co/POrUh2bq9H Tune in now to @FoxNews: I am joining @DanaPerino and @BillHemmer to discuss the crisis at our southern border and the Democrats' plan for a partisan takeover of America‚Äôs election systems. H.R. 1 is the Democrats‚Äô plan to take over the American election system and have it run by Washington bureaucrats. Democrats want to force all kinds of unpopular changes on all 50 states because they believe it would benefit their side. https://t.co/ZZZcZ77PHM Senate Democrats just spent the last four years using the legislative filibuster and talking constantly about how important it was.

Their reversals aren‚Äôt about principle. It‚Äôs just raw power. And their excuses insult the intelligence of the American people. A key purpose of the Senate was to ensure all parts of the country have a voice.
¬†
Leaders from New York and California want to break the Senate‚Äôs rules on legislation because they want to steamroll the interests of Kentucky and Middle America.
¬†
https://t.co/Tek5MhZCVx Secretary Mayorkas testified ‚Äúthe border is secure and the border is not open.‚Äù

So either @fema has been deployed just to admire a situation going smoothly... or the Biden Administration is not being straight with the American people. The science on getting kids back in school is crystal clear. Every day the Biden Administration does not urge schools to reopen safely right now with simple precautions, the most vulnerable kids pay the price. The Administration claims their top priority is to beat this virus and end the pandemic. But their nominee to run @HHSGov is woefully unqualified. California AG Xavier Becerra is a partisan politician with no expertise in healthcare. If Democrats break the Senate rules and kill the filibuster by a 50-50 vote, they will regret it. The pendulum would swing both ways, and it would swing hard. https://t.co/x2EM4EgTIc My definition of a crisis is when you send the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which only goes to emergencies, down to the border. 

This is a crisis. The Administration created it, and they own it. https://t.co/mDxERtkDjK Eliminating the legislative filibuster is not in the best interest of the country, no matter which party is in control.

Anyone who really understands the Senate knows that steamrolling the rules wouldn't fast-track policymaking. Everything would grind to a halt. https://t.co/S5a11JuTWN Top Democrats‚Äô drive to break Senate rules is shamelessly hypocritical. Just two years ago, they called the filibuster an essential part of the Senate that should never go away. 

Apparently their only principle is that they want Democrats to have all the power, all the time. https://t.co/FPzKemNSWU Tune in now to @FoxNews. I am joining @HARRISFAULKNER to discuss Democrats‚Äô border crisis and the importance of preserving Senate rules on legislation. Breaking Senate rules to kill the filibuster would not open up an express lane to liberal change. It would not open up an express lane for the Biden presidency to speed into the history books. The Senate would function more like a hundred-car pile-up. Nothing moving. I'm glad @SecBlinken and @SecDef are engaging with key Asian allies Japan and South Korea this week. We need to work together to defend against threats from China and North Korea and stand up for democracy in Burma in the face of military dictatorship. Why did President Biden tell Americans to wait until July 4th to gather in ways that cities, states, and the CDC approve right now?

Why did he present a million vaccines per day as a personal ‚ÄúMission Accomplished‚Äù moment when it‚Äôs simply the pace Democrats inherited in January? On Thursday, President Biden spoke in a heartfelt way about grief and loss. But his vision for the road ahead missed the mark. His proclamations broke with Dr. Fauci and his own CDC and ignored what Americans are already doing now. It was like a speech for an alternate universe. House Democrats' H.R. 1 is a partisan assault on elections. It directly targets political speech and would centralize control of elections in all 50 states in Washington Democrats‚Äô hands. 

A dramatic one-party power grab over the way Americans vote. https://t.co/ObjBkEnobS In 2020, Senate Republicans led Congress to pass five historic bipartisan bills. 

Because of that, the American people have been marching toward victory. Democrats just want to sprint to the front of that parade and claim the credit. https://t.co/fahYjj134x Our country has endured one of the most painful years in memory. But the dark times have spotlighted the best of America. 
 
This year‚Äôs recovery will ride an already turning tide. Not because of a Democrats‚Äô latest partisan bill, but because of the resilience of our people. https://t.co/2JC1V8ic30 Last Congress, Sen. Schumer and Democrats used the filibuster frequently. And I respected the institution more than any short-term advantage we might have achieved if we‚Äôd eliminated it. 
 
Majorities come and go, but the essence of the Senate stays. https://t.co/AbUmsKf6R5 President Biden's spending bill is a classic example of big Democratic overreach in the name of COVID relief. It manages to spend only ~1% on vaccinations and less than 9% on the entire health fight. 

This is by far one of the worst pieces of legislation I've seen in the Senate. https://t.co/lhU3wPm2kI The Administration is flailing and failing on our southern border. The number of unaccompanied children has tripled in two weeks. 

The White House keeps saying ‚ÄúNow is not the time to come.‚Äù So there will be a good time in the future to break federal law and come illegally? I‚Äôve voted for several of President Biden‚Äôs nominees. But his choices to lead Interior and the EPA appear eager to restart the left‚Äôs war on domestic energy. Kentuckians know that when radical policies are on the table, it means their jobs and pocketbooks are on the menu. House Democrats‚Äô attempt to forcibly rewrite 50 states‚Äô election laws would weaken voter I.D., mass legalize ballot harvesting, and let a partisan FEC poke around in more of citizens' political speech.

No wonder the only thing bipartisan about the bill was the vote against it. Senator Blunt has tackled so much important work for Missouri and our country and has been an enormous asset to all his colleagues. I‚Äôm very sorry he‚Äôll be stepping away but am glad the country has two more years to keep benefitting from his talent. My full statement: https://t.co/Q3HN53yaT5 Instead of working together to fight COVID-19, Democrats decided to exploit the crisis by jamming through unrelated liberal policies they couldn‚Äôt pass honestly. A colossal missed opportunity for the American people. My full statement: https://t.co/p321zYjGjU Democrats said they‚Äôd exploit COVID to ‚Äúrestructure things to fit our vision.‚Äù

Sure enough: Only 9% of their bill for the entire health fight. Only 1% for vaccines. All this borrowed money for a parade of unrelated policies that even left-wing experts say are badly targeted. We're already set to come roaring back ‚Äî not due to this liberal spending spree. Democrats inherited a tide that was already turning.

We could have worked together to do something smart &amp; bipartisan to finish this fight ASAP.

Democrats decided to do something else. I am continuing to monitor severe flooding across Kentucky. Yesterday I spoke with leaders in some of the hardest-hit counties. My staff and I are ready to do our part to get federal assistance to these communities. https://t.co/51otsqeSzp TUNE IN NOW: I'm joining @marthamaccallum to discuss the urgent priorities Senate Republicans are focused on -- reopening schools, helping workers, and getting more Americans vaccinated -- and the liberal wish-list Democrats are pushing instead. What the American people need are fast-acting plans to open schools now, get laid-off Americans into jobs, and finish the fight against COVID-19.
 
The Democrats‚Äô plan doesn‚Äôt focus on that. It manages to spend ~$2T while leaving the most urgent things on the cutting room floor. https://t.co/6UyBLBZPsH It was my honor to get to thank some of the @kentuckyguard who answered the call to help protect the Capitol. Your Congress and your country appreciate all you‚Äôve done. https://t.co/I09FN45AjW Less than 9% of Democrats' spending plan would go to directly fight COVID-19. Less than 1% to vaccinations. 

This isn‚Äôt a recipe to safely reopen America. It‚Äôs what Democrats promised almost a year ago: Taking advantage of the crisis to check off unrelated liberal policies. Only 1% of the Democrats‚Äô partisan bill goes to vaccines. Less than 9% to the entire health effort. It backs the Big Labor myth that schools can‚Äôt reopen safely right now ‚Äî yet only a small fraction of its K-12 money would go out this year.

Liberal ideology, not families' needs. More great news this morning as Kentuckians help turn the tide against COVID-19. The newly-approved Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is now shipping out, thanks to workers at McKesson‚Äôs distribution facility in Shepherdsville. https://t.co/VyOglbq0Fi The House‚Äôs partisan vote reflects a deliberately partisan process and a missed opportunity to meet Americans‚Äô needs. My full statement: https://t.co/AhM58wcIGK Washington should focus on practical policies to finish this fight. Accelerate vaccinations. Get kids back in school. Help laid-off Americans get rehired.

Instead, Democrats are pushing a partisan bill, packed with non-COVID-related spending &amp; bad ideas that will slow recovery. https://t.co/2SCBy1NlnX TUNE IN NOW: I am joining @BretBaier to discuss Republicans‚Äô work to help our nation reopen and recover ‚Äî and the $1.9T liberal spending plan the Democrats are focused on instead. https://t.co/VK9XdAnsh6 Only about 1% of the Democrats‚Äô partisan plan goes to vaccines. Only about 5% of its K-12 funding would even go out this fiscal year. 

Democrats are not addressing the urgent needs of a re-opening America. They started with a preconceived liberal wish-list and worked backwards. This evening I joined congressional leaders on the Capitol steps in a moment of silence for the 500,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus. https://t.co/FtsMr8Qurz Science and data disprove the Democrats' notion that K-12 schools need their new spending plan before they can open safely.

Under their plan, about 95% of the K-12 money would not even go toward the current year‚Äôs budget.

Stop letting Big Labor move the goalposts on our kids. The facts are clear: In-person schooling is essential for kids and can be safe. France and Spain have been doing it. The U.K. will have kids back in two weeks. A study from our own CDC last month found that schools can operate safely.

Why won't Democrats accept the science? The partisan bill Democrats are preparing is stuffed with non-COVID-related liberal goals and more band-aid policies as if the country were going to stay shut down another year.

We need 2021 to be different than 2020. Congress should focus on smart policies to help that happen. Families across Kentucky are still recovering from a week of punishing weather. I am grateful to everyone who pitched in and helped their neighbors stay safe. My team and I are focused and ready to help in the recovery. Rush Limbaugh was a generational media trailblazer. He gave a voice to millions of conservative Americans whom the mainstream media had not even tried to represent. His impact is impossible to overstate. May he rest in peace. For the three and a half decades that my friend Richard Shelby has served in the Senate, the people of Alabama have had a true heavyweight champion in their corner. I‚Äôm glad our friend still has two more years to continue his important and effective work here in the Capitol. Democrats' so-called relief bill includes Sen. Sanders‚Äôs minimum wage proposal that would kill 1.4M American jobs. This after the President killed many thousands of jobs with Keystone XL.

Killing jobs and destroying opportunity ‚Äî that's their idea of pandemic relief? Democrats admitted last March: They see the pandemic as an opportunity to ram through ideological change. 

That's why they are now pushing a sprawling $1.9T plan that even liberal economists say is poorly targeted to the urgent needs of our nation. George Shultz was one of the great Americans of our time. Nobody better exemplified a thoughtful, principled, and patriotic commitment to public service. A scholar-statesman for the ages. My full statement: https://t.co/lC8r9mNmm1 Pres. Biden's own scientists agree school appears to be quite safe and we should get our kids back.

Congress sent massive sums for K-12 schools in 2020. Hardly any of it has been spent yet.

Federal funding is not the issue. It's Big Labor moving the goalposts on kids &amp; parents. We‚Äôve heard a lot of talk about unity, but White House staff and congressional Democrats are working from the opposite playbook. Senate Republicans will be ready and waiting with a host of amendments to improve the rushed procedural step that‚Äôs being jammed through. https://t.co/HjAPLAg2Ae Science tells us that in-person school can be safe ‚Äî and is crucial for children‚Äôs futures. We cannot keep this essential part of our society on indefinite hiatus.

No more goalpost-moving from Big Labor. Kids have sacrificed enough. States and districts need to get this done. Science has spoken and the evidence is clear: It is time to get kids back in school. 

Experts say that with basic precautions, risks of transmission are low. And the costs of the online-only approach for kids are very high. This morning, Congress honored Officer Brian D. Sicknick under the dome of the institution he swore to defend ‚Äî and died defending. 
 
In the face of lawlessness, Officer Sicknick paid the ultimate price. His name will never be forgotten. https://t.co/sn7siRkQMh First Navalny was poisoned. Now he‚Äôs been jailed. Peaceful protesters across Russia are being suppressed. Just the latest in Putin‚Äôs long campaign to subvert democracy and the rule of law. The U.S. and our allies must continue strong measures to hold Putin and cronies to account. I‚Äôve had good conversations with @POTUS and @SecBlinken about the need for a swift and decisive response from the U.S. and allies following the coup in Burma. Expect the Administration will quickly sanction the junta and defend democracy. I‚Äôve voted for several of President Biden‚Äôs mainstream cabinet nominees. But his choice to run Homeland Security was blasted by the Obama Administration‚Äôs own Inspector General for running an immigration law favor factory for powerful Democrats. Bad pick with major ethics issues. I call on Burma‚Äôs military to immediately release the civilian political leaders of the country and turn back from this abyss. We need to support the people of Burma in their journey toward democracy and impose costs on those who stand in their way. My full statement: https://t.co/C2uOjnIVQx The last four years showed U.S. prosperity, domestic energy security, and reducing emissions do not have to conflict.
¬†
This Piecemeal Green New Deal through liberal executive orders gets it dead wrong.
¬†
There's nothing ""green"" about a tsunami of pink slips for American workers. Today, I made clear that if Democrats ever attack the key Senate rules, it would drain the consent and comity out of the institution. A scorched-earth Senate would hardly be able to function. It wouldn‚Äôt be a progressive‚Äôs dream. It would be a nightmare.

I guarantee it. The Senate requires collaboration and deliberation. It‚Äôs a feature, not a bug, that slim majorities can't ram through half-baked ideas.

My remarks on the legislative filibuster and why I stuck up for the minority‚Äôs rights even when Republicans had power: https://t.co/vtKFPDeVJe I‚Äôm glad that two Senate Democrats confirmed today they will not vote to end the legislative filibuster. They agree with President Biden and me on protecting the Senate.
¬†
With this win, we can move forward with a 50-50 power-sharing agreement built on the 2001 precedent. https://t.co/fHUCFxxXh8 It was my honor to get to meet and thank some of the @KentuckyGuard who answered the call to help protect the Capitol and the inauguration. https://t.co/yWguG607kR The failed Paris deal will hurt American families while China and Russia grow emissions.

The Keystone cancellation will kill union jobs and hurt U.S. energy security.

And a proposal to gut immigration enforcement and give blanket amnesty?

Rough ""day one"" for American workers. Minority rights on legislation are key to the Senate. President Biden spent decades defending them. More than two dozen Senate Democrats backed them just four years ago.

This isn't complicated. Simply reaffirming that Democrats won't break the rules should not be a heavy lift. Today, before the entire world, the greatest nation in history carried out another peaceful transfer of power.

Congratulations to President Biden and Vice President Harris. I look forward to working together everywhere we can and differing respectfully when we must. Tomorrow a new POTUS and VPOTUS will be sworn in. It will be secure because many other brave Americans have sworn their own oaths to support and defend our Constitution.

Thanks to the Capitol Police and all the federal &amp; local personnel helping protect our democracy this week. Today we honor one of our nation‚Äôs
great heroes. Dr. King called on America to truly fulfill our founding principles and provide justice and opportunity for all. His work and his example have brought us a long way and they inspire us to keep working. https://t.co/nOKGJS1Jlb My full statement on the next seven days and the Senate schedule: https://t.co/Nh5z3f79yq Our nation lost a remarkable American with the passing of Sheldon Adelson. Elaine and I send our condolences to Miriam, the entire Adelson family, and all who mourn today. May his memory be a great blessing. https://t.co/SHnRZlbLgF The Senate grieves the death of the officer who literally put himself on the line to defend our first branch of gov‚Äôt and everybody who works inside it. Our condolences and our prayers are with Officer Sicknick‚Äôs family and his colleagues at this terrible time. My full statement: https://t.co/FHm3T9Psvk The ultimate blame for yesterday‚Äôs events lies with the unhinged criminals who tried to disrupt our government and with those who incited them. But this fact does not preclude our addressing the shocking failures in the Capitol‚Äôs security posture and protocols. My full statement: https://t.co/2oJljGDiU8 The United States and the Senate will not be intimidated. 

We are back at our posts. We will discharge our duty under the Constitution for our nation.

And we are going to do it tonight. https://t.co/YH0PtXKDzt I will vote to respect the American people‚Äôs decision and defend our system of government. My full remarks: https://t.co/RSTjyjZmJq I applaud the President‚Äôs decision to get billions of dollars of crucial COVID-19 relief out the door and into the hands of American families. I am glad the American people will receive this much-needed assistance as our nation continues battling this pandemic. My full statement: https://t.co/YSPYsPu2ct Even in a dark winter, Christmas brings light. I am grateful for our healthcare heroes, the servicemembers who keep us safe, the modern miracle of safe and effective vaccines, and the blessing of our Savior's birth.
 
I wish your family a healthy and Merry Christmas. https://t.co/CMMZlkbdYw BREAKING: The Senate just passed another major bipartisan, COVID-19 relief package. The American people can rest assured that more help is on the way, immediately. Senate Republicans have been trying since July to get more targeted, bipartisan relief into the hands of the American people. Until the election, Democrats kept saying no.

I‚Äôm glad for our country that we are finally moving ahead together. https://t.co/G8PUrQgGN8 Tune in now: I‚Äôm joining @DanaPerino on @FoxNews to discuss the bipartisan, bicameral agreement for another major COVID-19 rescue package for the American people. BREAKING: As the American people continue battling the coronavirus this holiday season, they will not be on their own. 

Congress has just reached an agreement. We will pass another rescue package ASAP. More help is on the way. I think both sides agree: Our around-the-clock negotiations on COVID relief are hours away from completion. Our citizens need this waiting to end. Thousands of Americans are being robbed of their lives every day. Working families are hurting. Let‚Äôs finally get this done today. I appreciate the good-faith spirit that has characterized the bipartisan negotiations this past week. But the American people cannot feed their families or pay their bills with Congress‚Äôs good-faith discussions. They need us to act. We need to conclude talks and land this plane. Just received the safe, effective COVID vaccine following continuity-of-government protocols. Vaccines are how we beat this virus.

Now back to continue fighting for a rescue package including a lot more money for distribution so more Americans can receive it as fast as possible. https://t.co/kSBhI3EzzM The only way to beat this pandemic is for us to follow the advice of our nation‚Äôs health care professionals: get vaccinated and continue to follow CDC guidelines.¬†
¬†
My full statement: https://t.co/EJrC7f5lwq Productive conversations remain underway on COVID-19 relief. But Congress must not slide into treating these talks like routine negotiations at our routine pace.

This could not be more urgent. The Senate‚Äôs going to keep working right through the weekend until we get an outcome. https://t.co/aXGTFunsPH The American people have struggled heroically through this pandemic. They‚Äôve already waited too long for more relief. 

The Senate isn‚Äôt going anywhere until our bipartisan discussions reach an outcome for the American people. The American people need more help. We need vaccine distribution money. We need to re-up the Paycheck Protection Program to save jobs. We need to continue to provide for laid-off Americans.

Congressional leaders on both sides are going to keep working until we get it done. As a polio survivor, I am a huge supporter of vaccinations. Whenever my turn comes, I will absolutely take the vaccine and do my part to reassure anyone who‚Äôs doubtful. It‚Äôs the right thing to do for yourself, for your family, and for the country. https://t.co/xsHidTzN4s Attorney General Barr is one of the most dedicated and capable public servants I have ever seen in action. He has helped keep America safe from criminals and terrorists and advanced the bedrock American value of equal justice under law. My full statement: https://t.co/j5p7md8zy4 Thanks to the genius of science, the historic success of Operation Warp Speed, and the bold action of the Trump Administration, this should mark the beginning of the end of this terrible chapter.¬†

What an announcement. https://t.co/MgQyeXLCss The Senate just passed the National Defense Authorization Act. This annual bill will unlock the training, tools, and cutting-edge equipment that our servicemembers and civilian employees need as they bravely defend American lives and American interests. https://t.co/iaAEbtxoAt Today I am announcing the Senate swearing in day for the 117th Congress will be Sunday, January 3rd at 12:00 pm. Trial lawyers are among Democrats‚Äô most reliable sources of campaign cash.

Coincidentally, Democrats say they'd rather not pass *any* more aid (PPP, vaccine distribution, jobless aid) than limit the opportunity for the plaintiffs‚Äô bar to suck money from our nation‚Äôs re-opening. Yesterday, Democrats rejected two more GOP aid proposals in the space of two hours.

I‚Äôve proposed we set aside remaining sticking points and pass everything we agree on. They say ‚Äúno.‚Äù

And they now admit they blocked aid all summer &amp; fall because there was an upcoming election. The Senate knows all about end-of-year drama, but this time the stakes could not be higher. Americans are struggling under the weight of this pandemic. Democrats need to let Congress do our job &amp; pass more relief.

We have so much common ground. Let's make law. Let's get it done. Everyone understands this has been a challenging time for local leaders, but pandemics do not erase our First Amendment rights. I am glad that @kyoag is leading the way to defend the religious liberty of Kentuckians and all Americans.¬†https://t.co/1FtSX7w0mr Republicans have spent months proposing more COVID relief. Yesterday I put forward yet another proposal that would invest many billions in workers, laid-off Americans, small businesses, &amp; vaccine distribution.  

I hope Democrats will finally let us get a bipartisan outcome soon. Attorney General Barr was absolutely right to appoint John Durham to be a Special Counsel on this matter. The nation deserves to know the truth about the egregious abuses of power that took place in 2016 and deserves that justice be done to anyone who broke the law. https://t.co/ehCHSWacFk The American people need more help now. Congress should deliver more COVID relief this year.

Even House and Senate Democrats are publicly saying that Speaker Pelosi's and Leader Schumer's all-or-nothing obstruction needs to stop. We are blessed to live in the greatest country the world has ever known. Even in a trying year unlike anything we‚Äôve seen before, we are constantly reminded why. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. https://t.co/TkQfXbq5F2 Our country badly needs the kinds of targeted, urgent COVID relief that Republicans have been trying to pass for months ‚Äî from job-saving PPP funding to vaccine distribution.¬†

My full statement: https://t.co/ybJ2OJSYf9 For months, Republicans have tried to make bipartisan progress on huge areas of COVID relief where there's no disagreement.

Vaccine distribution funds.

Another round of the PPP for hard-hit small businesses.
 
But Democrats blocked it all over their unrelated liberal wish-list. .@ChuckGrassley had not missed a single vote in 27 years. Yesterday he paused that streak, on doctors‚Äô orders, while awaiting a COVID test result. 
 
The Senate is praying for continued good health for our president pro tempore and looking forward to seeing him again soon. Republicans have tried for weeks to pass another targeted rescue package. It would send hundreds of billions of dollars to schools, unemployment aid, another round of the job-saving PPP, and healthcare.
¬†
Democrats repeatedly blocked it all. Let's hope they let us make law soon. Another Democrat demand that‚Äôs blocked bipartisan aid: The fixation on a massive slush fund for state &amp; city govt's, unlinked from COVID need.

Some states are taking in more tax revenue this fall than they did before the pandemic.
 
It's struggling families who need urgent help. House Democrats‚Äô so-called ‚ÄúHEROES Act‚Äù is so unserious that it was condemned by the Speaker's own moderate Democrats the instant she put it out.
¬†
Huge tax cuts for rich people in blue states, but no second round of the Paycheck Protection Program? Those are their priorities? Months ago, skeptics dismissed President Trump‚Äôs aggressive timelines for vaccines. But our scientists are making history, with a huge assist from Operation Warp Speed. It's sped up research &amp; laid groundwork for fast distribution once a vaccine is confirmed safe and effective. More huge news this morning in COVID-19 vaccine development. The kinds of headlines we've longed for.

But we must stay careful for the next weeks and months. Wear our masks. Keep social distance. We've come this far and victory is in sight. Let's not surrender to the virus now. The Trump Administration has made huge strides in the Middle East: taking out terrorist leaders, brokering historic deals, &amp; moving US forces into support roles as Afghans lead the fight for their country.

Premature retreat would put this record at risk. https://t.co/egVaLJSIlS It is sad to see leading Democrats including some Governors treat the vaccine news like a mixed blessing because it occurred under a Republican administration. Some things must be bigger than politics.

Leaders should be cheering this on, not baselessly undermining science. This week‚Äôs news on a COVID-19 vaccine was incredibly promising. All of us have to keep up commonsense precautions in the meantime. The virus is spreading quickly in Kentucky and nationwide, and it doesn‚Äôt care whether we‚Äôve gotten bored with wearing masks or social distancing. Today, we reflect on the heroism of America‚Äôs veterans and those currently serving in uniform.

From the Greatest Generation to our 21st-century fighting force, we owe all veterans our gratitude and respect.
 
Happy Veterans Day. https://t.co/TL2cI46ESm This news confirms what Republicans have said for months:

Our country needs more smart, focused relief that is targeted to schools, healthcare, small businesses, &amp; those who are hurting the most.

Not the absurd multi-trillion-dollar socialist wish-lists Democrats have demanded. American workers are rebuilding our economy stronger &amp; faster than anyone predicted.
 
Experts predicted double-digit unemployment into 2021. Instead, it‚Äôs down to 6.9%. More than 630k new jobs just last month.
 
Too many are still hurting. Our work isn't done. But what progress. Grateful to my Senate Republican colleagues for their unanimous confidence in me to continue serving as Leader. We have a lot more to do to continue fighting for working families and strengthening our great country. https://t.co/Vh8yNkC3Pl Yesterday, we learned one COVID-19 vaccine candidate may be more than 90% effective. 

This huge good news is a testament to the ingenuity of the American private sector and the historic groundwork laid by Congress and the Trump Administration. https://t.co/TtcD2TpmJC Here‚Äôs how this must work in our great country: Every legal vote should be counted. Any illegally-submitted ballots must not. All sides must get to observe the process. And the courts are here to apply the laws &amp; resolve disputes.

That's how Americans' votes decide the result. ICYMI: I joined @hughhewitt to discuss confirming Justice Barrett to the Supreme Court and Democrats‚Äô threats against our governing ¬†institutions:¬†https://t.co/ArVnvccID9 Tune in now: I am joining @guypbenson to discuss the Senate‚Äôs successful confirmation of Justice Barrett to the Supreme Court.¬†https://t.co/HC2JtVXHgB ICYMI: I joined @ShannonBream to discuss confirming Justice Barrett to the Supreme Court, Democrats‚Äô continued threats to pack the courts, and Speaker Pelosi continuing to block COVID-19 relief. https://t.co/NCA7FsTxzQ Tune in now: I‚Äôm joining @ShannonBream on @FoxNews to discuss the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Senate just confirmed Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States.

One of the most impressive nominees for public office in a generation will serve for life on our highest court. https://t.co/qkJ0FPbTv1 The Senate just voted to advance one of the most qualified nominees in generations. Judge Barrett‚Äôs intellectual brilliance, integrity, and commitment to impartiality are above reproach.
 
Tomorrow, we will vote to confirm the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. More coronavirus resources are on the way to Kentucky. With the help of @HHSGov &amp; @usedgov, Kentucky students &amp; teachers will receive more than two million masks.
 
One of the most important things we can do to protect ourselves &amp; others is to wear a mask. https://t.co/1AtyoYmush Democrats cannot use ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù as a synonym for ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt get our way.‚Äù

Democrats keep demanding the President repeat that the election will be valid even if he dislikes the outcome. But they're flunking that test badly with Judge Barrett's nomination. https://t.co/Lvf0DtlA6Y For the third time this year, the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts have guided an historic step forward in the Middle East. Yesterday‚Äôs announcement of normalized relations between Israel and Sudan is good news for peace-loving people everywhere. With no good arguments to stop Judge Barrett, Democrats have resorted to blatant falsehoods. Inventing fake Lincoln quotes. Lying about this moving faster than many past confirmations.

Facts, not falsehoods, are going to carry the day in the Senate. https://t.co/pxAeYmkfn6 Tune in now: I‚Äôm joining @DanaPerino on @FoxNews to discuss Judge Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court and Democrats‚Äô continued blockade of COVID-19 relief for struggling Americans. This morning, the Judiciary Committee reported Judge Barrett‚Äôs nomination to the Senate floor. Their unanimous recommendation was that she be confirmed. 

This nomination will receive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor in the next several days. Our Constitution forbids disqualifying people from public service due to their religious beliefs. The far left has either forgotten this or just doesn‚Äôt care. It only underscores why we need well-informed jurists like Judge Barrett to protect our Constitution &amp; Americans‚Äô rights. https://t.co/9iCPWs3V7P Senate Democrats just used the filibuster ‚Äî which they say they dislike ‚Äî to kill another coronavirus relief package.
 
Unemployment benefits. PPP. Testing. Vaccines. School funding. Protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
 
Every Democrat just voted to block it all. NOW: The Senate is voting on another rescue package for American families.

Testing. Treatments. Vaccines. Unemployment aid. Another PPP. Historic money for schools. Find common ground &amp; get help out the door.

We'll see if Democrats use the filibuster to kill the bill. Democrats have said we shouldn‚Äôt pass any more relief at all unless Speaker Pelosi gets her whole far-left wish list, including all kinds of non-COVID-related demands. 

Working families in Kentucky and around the country deserve better than this obstruction. The Paycheck Protection Program has made a critical difference for millions of working families. Today, I‚Äôm having the Senate vote on a new second round for the hardest-hit small businesses.
 
Democrats say they support the PPP. Let‚Äôs see how they vote. Democrats have delayed aid for months over non-COVID-related liberal demands. Last night, Leader Schumer even tried to adjourn the Senate for three weeks. Americans need help; Democrats just want to go home.
 
We are voting on more aid this week. Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs all-or-nothing act has kept Americans waiting for months. We badly need Congress to agree where we can, get money out the door now, and keep arguing over the Speaker‚Äôs non-COVID-related wish list later.

We'll vote on hundreds of billions in more aid this week. Last week, Judge Barrett proved she has the deep legal expertise, judicial temperament, and intellectual horsepower that Americans deserve to have on the Supreme Court. The Senate will turn to her nomination as soon as it comes out of committee later this week. I just announced the Senate will vote next week on hundreds of billions more dollars for relief programs that Democrats do not even oppose. Working families have already waited too long for Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs Marie Antoinette act to stop. Let's make law. https://t.co/iR7OYKuCKw Judge Barrett exhibited every bit of the intellectual brilliance, legal expertise, and open-minded judicial temperament that we need on the Supreme Court. I will proudly vote to confirm her. The Senate will take up her nomination as soon as it comes out of Committee. https://t.co/KkOGo0JVKL It is bizarre to watch Vice President Biden and Democrats refuse to give a straight answer on their own party‚Äôs threats to pack the Supreme Court. But it is even more absurd for them to try to redefine ‚Äúcourt-packing‚Äù to mean any judicial confirmation that disappoints Democrats. https://t.co/RpZbaXNO2m We don‚Äôt agree with Speaker Pelosi that ‚Äúnothing‚Äù is better than ‚Äúsomething‚Äù for workers.

Senators will vote on more relief next week, including more PPP money to stop layoffs. We‚Äôll be able to pass it before we turn to Judge Barrett's nomination unless Democrats block it again. https://t.co/paJFhx5HcI Judge Barrett is just as brilliant and impressive as advertised. She is clearly qualified. She‚Äôs committed to fairness and impartiality. And she clearly understands the job of a judge under the Constitution is to apply the law and not impose personal policy views. The far left has been threatening our basic institutions of government since long before this Supreme Court vacancy. When today‚Äôs Democrats lose one election or one vote on the Senate floor, they start threatening to tear up the rulebook. https://t.co/CT3rnShGZD Judge Barrett is a stellar nominee. I think the president picked the single best person he could have picked anywhere in the country. This is a woman of extraordinary achievement. https://t.co/E1pyp1PPHU ICYMI: I joined @marthamaccallum to discuss the Senate‚Äôs months of success with hybrid hearings, Judge Barrett‚Äôs outstanding qualifications, and Democrats‚Äô refusal to get serious on COVID-19 relief talks. https://t.co/QrBro8587T The ongoing attacks by Senate Democrats and the media on Judge Barrett‚Äôs faith are a disgrace. They demean the confirmation process, disrespect the Constitution, and insult millions of American believers. https://t.co/Qg5mFQzWFO President Trump made an outstanding choice in Judge Amy Coney Barrett. She is one of the finest legal minds of her generation. She‚Äôs won national admiration for her example of strong female leadership. She‚Äôs exactly the kind of person Americans deserve on their highest Court. https://t.co/eYEle2s1nw Judge Barrett‚Äôs hearings will begin one week from today. Chairman Graham has all the tools to conduct a hybrid hearing, just like the 150 others the Senate has held this year.
¬†
We will not stop working for the American people because Democrats are afraid they may lose a vote. Democrats say they‚Äôll try everything to stall Judge Barrett. The latest excuse: Hybrid hearings with some virtual participation are suddenly bad.¬†

The Senate has held 150 of these hybrid hearings since May. Democrats have taken advantage of the tools. They‚Äôve praised the format. Just had another great call with @POTUS. He sounds well and says he‚Äôs feeling good. We talked about the people‚Äôs business ‚Äî fighting the pandemic, confirming Judge Barrett, and strengthening the economy for American families. Let‚Äôs keep our President &amp; First Lady in our prayers. Senate floor proceedings will be postponed¬†until October 19th.¬†The @SenJudiciary confirmation hearings for Judge Barrett‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court will convene¬†on October 12th¬†as scheduled by Chairman Graham. My full statement: https://t.co/7ThKZPJBZG ICYMI: I joined @HughHewitt this morning to discuss Judge Barrett‚Äôs outstanding qualifications, the decision by some on the left to attack her religious faith, and the Democrats‚Äô ongoing threats against our governing institutions.¬†https://t.co/Ze5EbW63qH Just finished a great phone call with @POTUS. He‚Äôs in good spirits and we talked business ‚Äî especially how impressed Senators are with the qualifications of Judge Barrett. Full steam ahead with the fair, thorough, timely process that the nominee, the Court, &amp; the country deserve. Happy to hear the White House physician‚Äôs report that @POTUS and @FLOTUS are feeling well following their positive tests for COVID-19. Let‚Äôs continue to pray today and every day for our President and our First Lady and for all those impacted by COVID-19. Tune in now to @BretBaier. I‚Äôll be discussing Judge Barrett‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court and the Democrats‚Äô ongoing obstruction of more bipartisan COVID-19 relief. Everyone who knows Judge Barrett, across the political spectrum, praises her independence and impartiality.

A judge's job is to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead. Nothing more, nothing less.

It's revealing how much this basic concept seems to scare the far left. Democrats want to pack the Supreme Court. Vice President Biden refused to rule it out last night. Now Senate Democrats are demanding promises and pre-commitments from Judge Barrett.
¬†
Judicial independence is vital to the rule of law. Why are Republicans alone in defending it? Judge Barrett is an exemplary judge and a qualified nominee for the Supreme Court. Her legal peers across the political spectrum praise her independence, fair-mindedness, and impartiality. That is exactly what the American people deserve on their highest Court. https://t.co/Eawb6JuCeX Multiple times, with multiple nominees, Senate Democrats have said or implied that certain personal religious beliefs make Americans unfit to serve. Judge Barrett in 2017 was only one example. Now the media‚Äôs joining in.

These tactics need to stop now. https://t.co/wisPUKXe2O I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Barrett earlier today. President Trump has nominated exactly the kind of outstanding person whom the American people deserve to have on their highest Court. https://t.co/0tTJqPwpeP Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptionally impressive jurist and an exceedingly well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court.
¬†
A brilliant scholar. An exemplary judge. President Trump could not have made a better decision. https://t.co/FKadx6TJeU Tune in: I‚Äôm about to join @ShannonBream @foxnewsnight for my first interview on the Supreme Court vacancy. The Senate will do what we did in 2016: Follow history, follow precedent, and do the job we were elected to do. The far left called John Paul Stevens anti-woman. They said Anthony Kennedy would turn back the clock. David Souter was going to hurt ‚Äúwomen, minorities, dissenters, &amp; other groups"" from the bench.
 
Anyone doubt the same old smears will be rearing their heads starting Saturday? We don‚Äôt know which legal all-star the President will nominate on Saturday. So isn't it curious that everyone already knows exactly what smears and scare tactics the far left will trot out?
 
Their playbook has not changed for 45 years. The nominee is irrelevant to their attacks. My full statement on Breonna Taylor, yesterday‚Äôs announcement, and the violence overnight in my hometown of Louisville: https://t.co/NN70M9oun8 The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th. There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792. House Democrats‚Äô first government funding bill intentionally left rural America behind. But @SenJoniErnst and other Republicans did not let the Democrats defund farm country. They secured the Commodity Credit Corporation funding that our farmers and ranchers depend on. Yesterday, Sen. Schumer decided to vent his frustration by blocking a bipartisan Intelligence Committee meeting on counterintelligence with a leading expert on protecting our elections.

A partisan temper tantrum is one thing. Jeopardizing national security is a different story. Rewarding Democrats‚Äô tactics now would not stop their attacks on our institutions. Their threats predate this new vacancy by over a year.
 
Their recklessness only underscores the importance that we do our job and confirm a nominee who truly respects the Constitution. Democrats are threatening to attack the foundations of the Senate and the Court if they do not get their way.
 
Here's the problem with this attempted blackmail: They have already been making these threats for many months. They've been campaigning on them for over a year. Our Senate majority will do exactly the same thing in 2020 that we did in 2016: Follow Senate history, follow the clear precedent in each situation, and do exactly the job we were elected to do.
¬†
We are going to vote on President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court this year. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a generational legal giant and a trailblazing champion for American women. The Senate is grieving with the nation, praying for her family, and remembering her historic legacy.

My full Senate floor remarks: https://t.co/mfVTHURqIw House Democrats‚Äô rough draft of a government funding bill shamefully leaves out key relief and support that American farmers need. This is no time to add insult to injury and defund help for farmers and rural America. The Senate and the nation mourn the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the conclusion of her extraordinary American life.

Because if you can HEAR the weapon, you can save lives.
https://t.co/MKtW5mWGYv The sound of gunshots is what signals you to run, hide, take cover, call the police and help others save themselves. Silencers muffle that sound, putting more innocent lives at risk, including those of law enforcement. 

These instruments of murder have no place on our streets. https://t.co/qgzG6Npsx2 That's why we must immediately cancel student loan debt for the millions of Americans and especially the people of color for whom student loan debt has turned the dream of a college education into a financial nightmare that haunts them for decades. When you're barely keeping your head above water, it‚Äôs a heck of a lot harder to make a dent in your student loan principal. The student loan debt tax relief provision that I wrote was included in the #AmericanRescuePlan and it paves the way for @POTUS to cancel student loans immediately. He must not wait any longer! #CancelStudentDebt https://t.co/Ljwr1uOQH7 It doesn't have to be this way.

#NationalBorinqueneersDay https://t.co/ZBoUGvnIR9 During today‚Äôs @SenateBanking hearing I made it clear we need a transformative infrastructure plan that invests in low-income &amp; minority communities, integrates housing, transportation &amp; environmental elements, expands homeownership and economic development. 
 
Watch below ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/FtAgNoCaJl 2/ That‚Äôs why we must pass the #HealthyFamiliesAct! #COVID19 has devastated communities, and the Healthy Families Act gives us an opportunity for a fresh start and to help bring economic stability back to those hit the hardest by the pandemic. #HFANow #PaidSickDays 1/ Working mothers have suffered during the #COVID19 pandemic. They have faced job and economic losses, and been forced to choose between caring for a loved one or keeping their job. The impact will last for years unless Congress takes action. https://t.co/jXWAEqsUVm Nice to meet with Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, who has deep NJ roots and 20+ years of federal health policy experience.

She will be a fantastic Administrator for @CMSGov who will prioritize reducing disparities and increasing equity in our health care system. https://t.co/B7zqMohffn A great choice by @POTUS! Anne Milgram has a long history in NJ as the state‚Äôs Attorney General.

She will be an excellent DEA Administrator, who will work diligently to fight drug trafficking and keep dangerous substances like fentanyl off our streets. https://t.co/M5am5KTbDD 2/ @POTUS needs to cancel up to $50K in student loan debt immediately! #CancelStudentDebt https://t.co/pQ8xPvqQry 1/ In NJ, an estimated 1.3M borrowers hold $48.8B in student loan debt, w/ an average balance of more than $33,000.

If borrowers like Jasmine Metellus or Roberto Cabanas were relieved of this burden, they could build good credit, buy their first home or open a small business. https://t.co/4MTEktLtFy Ramadan Mubarak to all of our Muslim brothers and sisters in New Jersey and around the world who are celebrating.

#GetVaccinated 2/ There is no time to waste as cities are seeing spikes in ghost gun-related crimes and as their popularity grows among white supremacists, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm especially pleased that @POTUS is using his authority today to crack down on the proliferation of ‚Äòghost guns‚Äô. 1/ I‚Äôve long advocated for the federal government to close the ‚Äòghost gun loophole‚Äô in our gun laws, which allows any criminal with an internet connection to buy an untraceable gun kit online without a background check.

#CloseGhostGunLoophole https://t.co/zAj5n14OXc 4/ We must not stand idly while Americans get killed each and every day as a result of gun violence, and I am cautiously optimistic today will set a new path forward that will help us save lives. #EndGunViolence 3/ I also stand ready to pass critical legislation in Congress to close loopholes in the background check system, ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines, repeal the Tiahrt amendment, and eliminate gun manufacturers‚Äô immunity from liability. https://t.co/nmTkU99BqL 2/ As we move forward, I will continue to urge the Biden Administration to deliver on the President‚Äôs campaign pledge to reinstate export control of semiautomatic firearms to the State Department. 1/ Today‚Äôs executive actions are only the first of many federal steps that must be taken to finally put an end to the scourge of gun violence that has sadly turned places of worship, concerts, movie theaters, grocery stores, and schools into open targets. https://t.co/bhKd8ipDjB 2/ These actions are a welcome change from the previous administration, which along with Republican members of Congress, bent to the will of the NRA and did nothing as more than 100,000 Americans were killed by a gun during Trump‚Äôs presidency. 1/ Today‚Äôs executive actions prove that elections have real consequences.

@POTUS is taking much-needed action to address gun violence.
https://t.co/zexvVmxix6 As we celebrate National Public Health Week, let us reflect on the power of community - the coming together of neighbors with one common purpose.
¬†
Only by coming together over the last year¬†&amp; throughout the months ahead will we overcome the pandemic and have a strong recovery. https://t.co/DQzUiL0wfi Housing is infrastructure. https://t.co/NMWeZHuzc1 2/ This decision by @POTUS will ensure communities of color and working people have equitable access to the vaccine and will bring us closer to fully reopening our state and country.
https://t.co/avo70tkWFQ 1/ This is great news!

Community Health Centers have been on the frontlines of this pandemic, providing critical care to struggling families across NJ and the country. https://t.co/gX3LuogFHc During this National Minority Health Month, we must do everything in our power to ensure the most at-risk among us are #VaccineReady.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll keep fighting every day until everyone in New Jersey and across the country has¬†equitable access to the #COVID19 vaccine. https://t.co/PGl2fmcghV 4/ Today, as we mourn the passing of our good friend, may we find solace in his courage and may his memory inspire us during the battles ahead. https://t.co/vKcDlrOZTi 3/ He was never a man to fear anything, and during the last two years he never stopped fighting for his constituents and all Americans ‚Äì even as he faced his toughest battle. 2/ As a pioneering civil rights activist throughout his career, @RepHastingsFL fought for a version of our nation that lived up to its promise and for a government that recognized the needs of everyone. 1/ South Florida and the country have lost a powerful voice for justice and equality in America.

It‚Äôs outrageous.
 
The Senate must act to save our democracy! 1/ Last night, Gov. Kemp signed into law one of the most egregious acts of voter suppression in modern history. He has stripped away the essence of democracy for the people in GA and placed it in the hands of his GOP cronies and election conspiracists. https://t.co/gWyCmzqW3s 2/ I‚Äôve been raising the alarm over these untraceable DIY weapons for nearly a year and I‚Äôm thrilled to see some action by the Biden Administration. It‚Äôs simple to me: if it looks like a gun and works like a gun ‚Äì it should be regulated like a gun. https://t.co/tjIRnRkjxM 1/ In today‚Äôs America, anyone w/internet access &amp; about $400 can buy a ghost gun kit online &amp; build an AR-15‚Äìno questions asked. Deadly as any other firearm too. https://t.co/08ceI7gXwZ 4/ Weapons of war do not belong on our streets. No one should fear going to a church, synagogue, concert, school or grocery store. The time for @POTUS to take action is now. We can‚Äôt wait any longer. https://t.co/lz4sRve4kD 3/ @SenBooker and I have introduced and cosponsored a number of bills to curb gun violence in America, only to be stonewalled by the GOP and their gun lobby accomplices. https://t.co/QkqN371Xvx 2/ It‚Äôs time we ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and pass universal background checks.  It‚Äôs common sense and supported by a majority of Americans. https://t.co/X3VA6xy7eq 1/ Today I joined @SenBooker to speak out against inaction and speak up for common sense gun safety reform. A functioning democracy cannot only offer ‚Äòthoughts and prayers‚Äô when faced with an unrelenting epidemic of this proportion.

The Paycheck Protection Program has been extended through the end of May.

https://t.co/o7cVV3YClJ Today, I am introducing a bill to expand and improve access to veterans who‚Äôve served and continue to serve in the Gulf region.

https://t.co/1cpVzt8ybS A few weeks ago we marked the 30th anniversary of the end of the Gulf War. Our veterans made invaluable sacrifices for peace in America and abroad. Proud to lead a bipartisan effort w/ @SenKevinCramer to expand VA health benefits for WWII vets exempt from eligibility. The 325K WWII vets still alive today deserve our support. This bill provides hospital care, medical services, &amp; nursing home care.

https://t.co/k61yJ2BUI6 2/ With this legislation, we can investigate and solve more gun related crimes, reduce gun trafficking, and provide the necessary data to researchers on how guns find their way to the hands of criminals.
 
It‚Äôs time that we show that the people are in charge, not the NRA. https://t.co/kfbr2ZUd6S 1/ Today I am introducing the Gun Records and Restoration Act alongside @RepBarbaraLee. This bill repeals Republican efforts to prevent federal law enforcement and prosecutors from collecting, preserving, and sharing gun data with local authorities. https://t.co/fuOq5AyCG4 The #AmericanRescuePlan delivers relief to women and families by cutting childcare costs and providing much needed tax relief to help cover the cost of raising children.

This very fact has been on display every day over the last year of this pandemic. https://t.co/CNiJVU2i5V A lack of policies that support family caregiving are contributing factors to the gender #wagegap.

The Equal Rights Amendment must be enshrined in our Constitution and the law of the land. #WHM 1/ It‚Äôs 2021 &amp; for the 7th time I will introduce the #ERA.

We‚Äôre already seeing the impacts of climate chaos: severe droughts, devastating wildfires, and more frequent mega storms. And communities of color and low-wealth Americans bear the brunt. I‚Äôm introducing the #KeepItInTheGround Act to help us tackle climate chaos. We still have a ways to go to ensure that everyone in our country has access to adequate and affordable health care, but after four years of attacks on Americans‚Äô ability to get coverage, we‚Äôre finally headed in the right direction again. https://t.co/l5v6NSU0a0 I‚Äôve worked closely with Vanita Gupta &amp; Kristen Clarke‚Äîincluding on the #EqualityAct. They are tremendous attorneys &amp; passionate champions for justice. I stand with @LGBTQ_Military &amp; the 28 undersigned LGBTQ organizations who support their nominations to key positions at DOJ. https://t.co/QsI32U3acP I‚Äôve heard from folks who had trouble getting through to the FEMA support line for COVID-19 funeral assistance. They‚Äôve shored up support after a high volume of calls, so if you need help please call 844-684-6333 or apply online at https://t.co/HGo5wOXLKA. https://t.co/8QclKZnVt9 This is the right course, long overdue. We‚Äôve lost 2,000 servicemembers and spent trillions in pursuit of an unachievable goal. 

https://t.co/HyOMREWcnb Glad to see you working on this issue, @ClimateEnvoy. Oregon has seen the impacts of climate chaos on our oceans firsthand. That‚Äôs why I introduced the OCEAN Act to fight to protect our oceans and our blue economy. #OceanClimateAction https://t.co/gRg98oG8bt To all those celebrating in Oregon and around the world: Ramadan Mubarak! May this holy month be a safe and blessed one for you and your loved ones. His death is a tragedy and a painful reminder of the work we must continue to do to root out systemic racism and make sure this country is just and equal for all. #BlackLivesMatter Daunte Wright should be alive today. He was stopped for having an air freshener? 

I am holding his loved ones in my heart and my prayers. We‚Äôre inviting corruption into our government by allowing lawmakers to trade stocks by night and vote on laws that affect their portfolio the next day. I have a bill with @SenSherrodBrown, @SenatorWarnock, and @CongressmanRaja to end this corruption. https://t.co/8le1cHoOyU If you‚Äôve lost a loved one, I encourage you to apply. Visit https://t.co/YlVIwJd1lV or call 1-844-684-6333 for assistance. Losing a loved one to COVID-19 is difficult‚Äîfamilies should not have to struggle to meet the costs of a funeral on top of dealing with that grief. This week, FEMA is opening a reimbursement program for COVID-related funeral expenses. The impact of plastics: It produces toxic fumes that poison our communities, disproportionately affecting our Black, Brown, and low-income neighbors. It‚Äôs choking our marine life. It‚Äôs infecting our water and food. We must #BreakFreeFromPlastic.
https://t.co/evvhP7LFXJ Power belongs with the people, not with special interests. 

If we want to make sure that our government is really of, by, and for the people, we need to pass the #ForThePeople Act. Monarch butterfly populations across America are collapsing. We must preserve the habitats of this iconic species to prevent its extinction. I‚Äôm working with @RepJimmyPanetta to pass legislation that will protect and expand monarch habitats. Republicans‚Äô strategy to gain power depends completely on gerrymandering, enabling billionaires to buy elections with dark money, and denying our freedom to vote. 

Ending all three is essential to defending our ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù republic!
https://t.co/jh4CeSEKs3 The climate crisis is bearing down on us. We dug the hole we‚Äôre in even deeper over the last four years and we don‚Äôt have time to waste. The American Jobs Plan is an important step to repairing our crumbling infrastructure, and moving to a clean energy economy. Let‚Äôs get it done! We must pass the #PROAct to end these union-busting tactics and ensure the next time workers try to unionize, they do so free from interference. Organizers were up against one of the largest companies in the world, which was using aggressive tactics. The efforts of organizers are crucial in the longer struggle for fair working conditions. Thank you to @BAmazonUnion and @RWDSU who fought to ensure that workers at Amazon in Alabama know their rights and were able declare their will to unionize. The same powerful polluters that fight against environmental justice are also fighting against #S1. 

They recognize what we should all realize: The battle for the environment is completely interconnected with the battle for democracy. 

#ClimateFriday https://t.co/IJfwOKaC8n There‚Äôs a reason why my colleagues, the President, and I are all in on the #ForThePeople Act and folks on the other side of the aisle are dead-set against it. 

(Hint: it involves corporate special interests and billionaires.) Polling shows 85% of voters want action to improve infrastructure now. And before negotiations even begin, McConnell shuts them down. The Senate GOP may not be onboard‚Äîbut Americans are. Let‚Äôs go big and deliver for the American people.
https://t.co/IJDnukzBoS The American Jobs Plan contains provisions to ensure that every lead pipe in America is replaced‚Äîa huge win. Let‚Äôs finally ensure that every American has clean drinking water straight from their tap. Disappointing, but not surprising. 
 
We cannot allow our financial system to be beholden to Big Oil, especially as we chart a path to a clean energy economy. I introduced legislation to stop this, and I‚Äôll fight to get it passed. 

https://t.co/Mw7aVY6xhB The legislation to ban health care for trans youth in Arkansas is cruel and dangerous. I will not stop fighting until we‚Äôve enshrined equality for all in federal law and made sure trans folks are treated with dignity and respect. These land mines maim or kill thousands of civilians, including children. Time for them to go. 

Team Biden: Do the right thing and reverse this Trump-era policy now.
https://t.co/M6ox4EiRY8 The American Jobs Plan is a big bet on the middle class. It‚Äôs a remake of our economy so your hard work creates a better future for your family, not more wealth for the richest. I look forward to working with the Biden administration to craft this legislation and deliver results. This is what a rigged tax system looks like. It‚Äôs time for massive corporations to pay their fair share.https://t.co/Kh8TFo52Ke Our elected officials should win office based on the strength of their ideas, not their ability to rig votes. We need to pass the #ForThePeople Act to ensure that voters are choosing their representatives‚Äînot the other way around. Scientists estimate that more than a garbage truck‚Äôs worth of plastics enters the ocean each minute.

We need to pass my #BreakFreeFromPlastic Pollution Act to tackle this growing crisis and protect our health and our planet. 
https://t.co/evvhP7LFXJ Democrats know we need to put PEOPLE ahead of arcane Senate procedure. Failure is not an option when it comes to passing the #ForThePeople Act, and I‚Äôm committed to getting it done‚Äîwith or without the filibuster.
https://t.co/Q2Yz5aQHkh Stay out of politics.... but, ""I‚Äôm not talking about political contributions."" 

Translation: Don't speak out against our attack on democracy but keep the dark money flowing. https://t.co/EKJbS5wzgF https://t.co/ZfCiq6Ep5b The #ForThePeople Act will stop billionaires from buying elections. So read this statement and know exactly what it‚Äôs saying: McConnell really loves dark money so billionaires can buy elections and REALLY, REALLY loves laws that create obstacles to Americans exercising their sacred right to vote.
https://t.co/mo8YyZ6Nht Mitch McConnell and his minions constantly divide and demonize and try to distract us with tired culture wars so they can keep looting America, sacrificing our shared future, and hold on to power. We must put environmental justice front and center as we address the climate crisis. The Biden administration should stand with @StandingRockST to say #NoDAPL. https://t.co/uYvaoXykFW I‚Äôm glad to see @POTUS taking this step. The student debt crisis is preventing millions of working Americans from being able to thrive. It‚Äôs critical that we #CancelStudentDebt.
https://t.co/e4glDHjKLF The GA GOP is now seeing the consequences of their turn against democracy, and I applaud the @MLB for this move. We all need to stand up for our freedom to vote so we all have a say in our nation‚Äôs key decisions. https://t.co/bWfUhBImdM Happy Easter to all those in Oregon and across the nation celebrating today. Wishing you and your loved ones a blessed and joyful holiday! Tragic news from @CapitolPolice today. I am so grateful for all of the first responders on the scene. Mary and I are holding the fallen USCP officer and the injured officer, and their families, and the entire USCP force in our heart and prayers. The American Rescue Plan is already getting Americans back to work! We‚Äôve got more work to do to make sure everyone has the opportunity to thrive‚Äîlet‚Äôs keep it up! #HelpIsHere https://t.co/AtwCbifbxA The #ForThePeople Act takes on corruption in our political system, putting an end to the dark money that floods our elections. It‚Äôs a critical piece of ensuring that America has a government responsive to the will of the people. 

Why are Republicans so scared of that? I remember the darkest days of 2017 during the fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I remember the late night fight on the Senate floor to save health care for millions. 

To everyone that marched, organized and voted: You made this change possible.
https://t.co/0PbusAsUxL This package will create good jobs in all parts of the country, bring back manufacturing, invest in the things that will keep the economy growing and make sure that growth benefits workers, not Wall Street. It‚Äôs about time! I‚Äôve lived in the same blue collar neighborhood for decades, and every year my neighbors seem to have more debts and fewer opportunities. The American Jobs Plan can change that. As we rebuild our economy, we must ensure that that the opportunity to thrive isn‚Äôt granted only to the wealthiest Americans. As Paul Wellstone said, we all do better when we all do better. A prosperous, growing middle class is how we build back better. #HelpIsHere https://t.co/M2f0s05DQb John Lewis called the right to vote ‚Äúsacred.‚Äù But in 2021 alone, 361 voter suppression bills have been introduced across 47 states.

We can protect his legacy‚Äîand our sacred right to vote‚Äîby passing the #VoterEmpowermentAct as part of the #ForThePeople Act. https://t.co/ZbKiUyE24Y For the last 40 years, we‚Äôve seen prosperity and profit flow almost exclusively to the wealthiest Americans. It‚Äôs our responsibility ensure every American shares in our national progress. Biden's American Jobs Plan is bold and it could be even more ambitious. Let's go big! 361 bills to restrict voting rights have been introduced across 47 states. 

This is not just a problem in Georgia‚Äîvoter suppression bills are on the rise across the nation. We need to pass the #ForThePeople Act. Now. https://t.co/4wE4GwHD9a Yesterday‚Äôs sentencing of the Honduran President‚Äôs brother is emblematic of the Honduran government's corruption and impunity. Congress should pass my bill to take on corruption in Honduras. https://t.co/T53gwAFi83 President Biden just laid out a plan that will restructure our economy to benefit all Americans‚Äînot just the wealthiest. 

This is leadership that will help move our entire nation forward and ensure no community is left behind. A great starting point to tackle the problems holding us back: Strong Buy American components. Investments in water infrastructure, housing &amp; EVs. All while ensuring the jobs created are good-paying &amp; union. This is how we build an economy for all of us, not just the powerful. https://t.co/RtSnKd2Mjj What does the #ForThePeople Act do? 

It stops billionaires from buying elections. Let's get it passed!
https://t.co/ZfCiq6mOdD Everyone in this country deserves equal dignity, respect and opportunity. We cannot tacitly accept the daily discrimination faced by trans people in our country‚Äîwe must call out injustice and fight for a better future by passing laws like the #EqualityAct. #TransDayOfVisibility Today, @RepRitchie, @SenGillibrand, @SenWarren, and I are calling on @POTUS to include a transformative investment in affordable housing in the infrastructure package. We can‚Äôt build back better without fixing the housing crisis facing so many Americans. https://t.co/So2hfGzU9L We the people don‚Äôt want a credit card‚Äôs worth of plastics in our food. We want environmental justice.  We want to #BreakFreeFromPlastic. Who‚Äôs opposed? The powerful. We need to pass the #ForThePeople Act so government works for us, not the wealthy special interests. https://t.co/O7YZoObFGd These nominees are breaking down barriers and ensuring those who preside over our courts more closely resemble the communities they serve. Thank you, @POTUS. https://t.co/F5arL4Prnj This is huge: 90% of adults will be eligible to get their coronavirus vaccine within the next three weeks. https://t.co/F3BqhG0vH9 Voter suppression, gerrymandering, and dark money are all intended to stop the people‚Äôs voices from actually shaping our government. Our best chance to fight back is getting the #ForThePeople Act to @POTUS‚Äôs desk as quickly as possible. The #ForThePeople Act will empower voters, help get big money out of politics, and level the playing field for working families. This is what government of, by, and for the People looks like. Voting rights are under attack across our nation. If we want to tackle climate chaos, housing, education, and health care, we have to first protect our democracy. That means passing the #ForThePeople Act. Incredible second half comeback by @BeaverMBB to tie Houston at 55 with minutes left! You played with guts and grit until the very end‚Äîgreat season! Cheering on our @BeaverMBB, who are playing Houston right now in the March Madness Elite Eight!!

https://t.co/1UhnF6evAH Oregon has been using vote-by-mail for decades and it‚Äôs proven to be:

‚úÖ Fair
‚úÖ Convenient
‚úÖ Secure

The #ForThePeople Act will give all Americans the chance to vote by mail. The ballot box is the pulsating heart of our democracy. As a Senator, it‚Äôs my responsibility, under my oath to the Constitution, to defend the right of every citizen to participate in elections. That‚Äôs why I introduced the #ForThePeople Act, and why I‚Äôm fighting to get it passed. https://t.co/sHOYnxX4xo Chag Sameach to those in Oregon and across the country celebrating the first night of Passover tonight. 

Wishing you and your loved ones peace, joy, and meaningful reflection. Unbelievable win for @BeaverMBB! Amazing fierce effort takes them from deep in the bracket to Elite Eight. Incredible! .@BeaverMBB is ahead by 7 in the second half against Loyola. Let's cheer them on to the Elite Eight! Momentum for the #ForThePeople Act is growing. https://t.co/ffB0LsRigt 90% of the American people believe the government is run by special interests. Unless you‚Äôre in that other 10%, you might want to ask Senate Republicans why they oppose getting big, dark money out of politics. 

#ForThePeople .@POTUS has taken bold steps to protect our environment by pausing offshore drilling leases. Now, we need to make these protections permanent. To #ProtectOurCoast, we need to end dirty and dangerous offshore drilling for good. #NoNewLeases The horrific shootings in Georgia are just the latest example of the rising tide of hate the AAPI community has faced throughout the pandemic. We must all work together to condemn racism and #StopAsianHate. https://t.co/ve1lrtTpVy Ending the filibuster would be catastrophic for the GOP obstruct-and-delay agenda. For the American people, it would mean that the broken Senate will finally address housing, education, good jobs and so many issues that it has failed to tackle for so long. https://t.co/cf7qJeNm7T The health and wellbeing of our people and our planet hinge on us acting with boldness and swiftness on the plastic pollution crisis. 

The #BreakFreeFromPlastic Pollution Act will do that‚Äîlearn more about why @RepLowenthal and I introduced this critical bill. 

#ClimateFriday https://t.co/hmGVQ4lTkd The climate crisis is one of the biggest threats we face. As fossil fuel companies continue to pollute unchecked and make this problem worse, insurance companies are underwriting these projects. That‚Äôs not sustainable. Insurance companies need to take climate chaos seriously. https://t.co/YRazyET4A2 It‚Äôs not just Georgia.
 
Hundreds of bills have been filed across 42 other states in 2021 alone to make it harder for folks to vote.
 
If Republicans made more of an effort to govern for the people, maybe they wouldn‚Äôt be so afraid of all of their constituents being able to vote. The CDC needs to extend the eviction moratorium, AND add protections for Americans who are imminently at risk of utility disconnection‚Äîheat, power, water, broadband. The CDC can and must act to stop shutoffs. https://t.co/t6ze9swYy1 When I talk about dangerous threats of voter suppression in state legislatures, this is what I mean. 

We need federal action to protect the sacred right to vote. Now. 

#ForThePeople https://t.co/aShKzLEObh It was. They are. And it‚Äôs gotta change if we want to get anything done for Americans. https://t.co/tA2HsETcjR Join us now! #BreakFreeFromPlastic

Read more here ‚¨áÔ∏è 
https://t.co/ipqDgwpinD We can‚Äôt just recycle our way out of this. We need to reform to move to an efficient circular economy. This bill will provide badly-needed national leadership to reduce plastic waste, reform our waste and recycling systems, and help us #BreakFreeFromPlastic. Plastic comes from petroleum, and production and waste are fueling climate change.  Plastics facilities disproportionately impact Black, Brown and low-income communities, who are already bearing the brunt of climate change. Plastic is everywhere: in our rainwater, in the soil that produces our food, and in our rivers, lakes, and oceans. It‚Äôs become nearly impossible to avoid exposure. No one wants to ingest (or wants their children to ingest) dangerous chemicals and microplastics. But right now we are‚Äîup to the amount in a credit card every single week. Disgusting! üßµ Thread: @RepLowenthal and I just introduced the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act. Here‚Äôs why &gt;&gt;&gt; Senators spend a lot of time calling wealthy donors.

The SAFE Banking Act would correct that. It‚Äôs way past time to pass common-sense gun safety legislation at the federal level.

Sandy Hook. Las Vegas. Parkland. They all should have been enough.

There is a mass shooting‚Äî4+ victims‚Äîabout once a day in America. A national background check system is well worth doing. This is a great first step. The next step should be to follow @SenWarren and @SenSchumer‚Äôs lead. They have a plan to #CancelStudentDebt, and it‚Äôs time to make that plan a reality.

https://t.co/aM8TtZR81z Proud to join @SenatorMenendez and a bipartisan group of my Senate colleagues on the Keeping Women and Girls #SafeFromTheStart Act to prevent and respond to gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. The Big Lie perpetuated by Trump and too many Republicans directly led to the attack on our Capitol on January 6th. It‚Äôs continuing to fuel efforts to disenfranchise American citizens. 

We must strengthen democracy. We must pass #S1. #ForThePeople Monarchs are inching closer to extinction. Protecting habitat for this iconic species would protect habitat for all the other pollinators our farmers, ag industry, and food supply rely on. We must pass my bill with @RepJimmyPanetta, the MONARCH Act, to #SaveTheMonarchs. The @BrennanCenter is tracking 253 bills across 43 states that would make it harder to vote. The #ForThePeople Act addresses these tactics head on by removing barriers to voting.

https://t.co/jo8tU2CZg8 Unfortunately, Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi chose to ignore our work, which is supported by a majority of Americans, and ram through a costly bill that has little to do with COVID-19. Last month, I joined a group of 10 Republican senators in offering @POTUS a targeted and far less expensive alternative to the Democrats‚Äô $1.9 trillion budget plan. This $1.9 trillion bill is filled with Democrat wish list items such as unnecessary infrastructure projects, state bailouts, climate change provisions and billions of dollars that won‚Äôt be spent for several years. https://t.co/mEGAMyLO6k This morning, the Senate adopted my amendment by unanimous consent to delay the start of the negotiated rulemaking process on the 90/10 loophole by six months to provide Congress more time to reach a bipartisan legislative agreement.

Thanks to @SenatorCarper for working w/ me on this bipartisan amendment. By providing a 6-month delay before the start of a negotiated rulemaking process, Congress now has time to work together w/ our veteran service organizations &amp; the #highered community on a bipartisan plan to deliver reasonable &amp; needed protections for veterans &amp; taxpayers alike.

I condemn the violence and destruction at the U.S. Capitol in the strongest possible terms. It is completely unacceptable and unpatriotic.
¬†
God Bless the @CapitolPolice &amp; our law enforcement officers.¬†Please pray for our nation. I am grateful for my colleagues serving on the House and Senate Veterans‚Äô Affairs Committees, as well as our partners from the Veterans Service Organizations for their work in creating this legislation that will positively impact veterans for years to come. Congress passed this critical end-of-year veterans package to enact changes &amp; provide support for every corner of our veteran community. I applaud @realDonaldTrump for signing this legislation into law to invest in the #GIBill &amp; provide economic opportunities for veterans. https://t.co/gIT3bSJezQ My statement on the joint session of Congress to count the results of the Electoral College in the Manhattan Mercury (@MERCnewsroom) ‚¨áÔ∏è

https://t.co/wdo0Dd7EBf The #Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has been delivered to @RobertJDoleVAMC in Wichita! There are over 1000 doses of the vaccine in this box which will be given to VA health care workers and veterans this week. https://t.co/mY0hevO69F I will continue to make certain that the VA has necessary resources to effectively administer the vaccine to our nation‚Äôs veterans and the staff that care for them in the timeliest manner possible. As chairman of @SenateVA, I am working with the @DeptVetAffairs to secure vaccines for Kansas VA facilities, with three locations receiving vaccine shipments today: Wichita, Topeka &amp; Leavenworth. Incredible sight to see as the first shipment of the Moderna vaccine arrived at @RobertJDoleVAMC in Wichita this morning!

https://t.co/SVAVxusjLN This targeted relief package should have been completed months ago, but ultimately I‚Äôm pleased that many of my priorities were included and that it provides necessary resources to continue manufacturing and distributing the vaccines to our communities. BREAKING: The Senate just passed a COVID-19 relief package to provide targeted federal relief during this ongoing pandemic.¬†
¬†
My full statement ‚û°Ô∏è¬†https://t.co/w3K86iw4oh The Moderna vaccine will be ideal for distribution in Kansas because it can be re-distributed to secondary VA sites throughout the state, including rural areas, to reach more veterans. As chairman of @SenateVA, I've worked closely with @DeptVetAffairs to make certain Kansas veterans have access to the #COVID19 vaccine. Today, the VA announced 3 VA facilities in Kansas - Wichita, Topeka &amp; Leavenworth - will receive the Moderna vaccine. While they only account for 15% of overall loans in the banking industry, they hold:
¬†
‚û°Ô∏è 30% of all commercial real estate loans
¬†
‚û°Ô∏è 36% of small business loans
¬†
‚û°Ô∏è 70% of agricultural loans Pleased to see the FDIC‚Äôs report on community banking indicate that, even while relatively small, community banks far exceed their relative size for lending in categories important for Kansans. https://t.co/ZZgqE8EYEl Pleased my bipartisan bill w/ @SenBlumenthal to reauthorize @usantidoping ahead of @OlympicsLA2028¬†passed the Senate this week.

Since its inception, @USADA has modeled integrity &amp; fair competition for the international athletic community &amp; anti-doping agencies worldwide. Met with @SecArmy to discuss Army priorities in KS &amp; to thank him for his years of public service. His leadership has modernized the world‚Äôs finest fighting force &amp; has invested in our Soldiers &amp; their families.

I encourage all Kansans to continue to take precautions to keep you &amp; your families safe, including wearing a mask, practicing social distancing &amp; frequently washing your hands. The success of Operation Warp Speed is an example of the exceptionalism that exists within American science &amp; medicine. While we still have a long road ahead, Kansans will soon have access to this safe and effective vaccine.

"Murkowski, Lisa",lisamurkowski,,Alaska,Alaska,Senator," Ensuring the #Arctic remains a zone of peace remains our priority, and we can do that by working together as Arctic nations toward common goals.

Watch here: https://t.co/i6agRvx77A Today at the 14th Conference of Parliamentarians of the Arctic Region, I spoke to the future of the #Arctic and questioned the panel on how we can utilize the lessons learned from #COVID19 to work more cooperatively and collaboratively in the Arctic. https://t.co/JF2ec9BX16 Thank you to all the organizations and individuals at the state, local, and tribal level who have helped get more Alaskans vaccinated and driven us forward on the path back to normal. https://t.co/ofDVIh1J5C Despite many unique challenges, #Alaska ranks among America's top states w/ distributing #COVID19 vaccines. Alaska‚Äôs tribal health organizations have been instrumental in the successful rollout of vaccines - some Native villages having vaccinated nearly 90% of their communities. We also strongly encourage @usedgov to explore a number of options for distributing these funds to ensure that both the immediate and larger, long-term needs are met. In our letter my colleagues and I called for continued collaboration between ED and the Senate to distribute the funds to support vulnerable homeless children and youth ‚Äì a population whose issues have only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding was included in the ARP through an amendment I offered with @Sen_JoeManchin and @SenatorSinema. I led a letter w/ @Sen_JoeManchin, @SenatorBurr, Sen. @PattyMurray &amp; @SenatorSinema to @SecCardona detailing priorities on the implementation of $800M in K-12 funding from the American Rescue Plan Act to address youth homelessness. https://t.co/gCNJdyZap8 Children and youth experiencing homelessness need comprehensive, wrap-around services in order to recover from the loss and disruption caused by the #COVID19 pandemic. These articles play a key role in providing up-to-date and relevant information to help inform #MMIWG efforts. We must continue to shine a light on the MMIWG crisis and prevent violence in these communities. Articles address topics such as building a multijurisdictional response; victim services; criminal jurisdiction in Indian country; investigating cold cases; the role of public health in prevention of violence; and trauma-informed, culturally relevant psychological responses. I applaud the @TheJusticeDept for publishing two editions of the Journal of Federal Law and Practice focused on issues related to missing or murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives. https://t.co/nGAZBrbrSO We also discussed @AlaskaCorps' potential projects they‚Äôll carry out with Congressional funding I helped secure, including their operations and maintenance efforts work to dredge the Port of Alaska as well as harbors in Dillingham, Homer, Ninilchik, Nome, and Wrangell. https://t.co/EP1KXmI5SO Had a productive discussion with Col.

Through my role on the Approps Committee, I fought to secure funding for @NOAA and to prioritize infrastructure projects such as this b/c of the value it will have on our understanding of our changing Arctic and marine environments. .@NOAA awarded an $18M contract to Ahtna to rebuild its port facility in Ketchikan, constructing a large floating pier, steel access trestle, new office building, and updated power &amp; water utility systems that will service visiting ships. https://t.co/HeAe4LkkF4 Great news for Alaska coming out of @NOAA today.

https://t.co/GyfajVbt9l Without cruise ship passengers, Alaska‚Äôs tourism-dependent businesses and communities have endured well over a year of lost revenue due to the #COVID19 pandemic and the resulting travel restrictions. I thank every single Capitol Police officer, including the members of the National Guard, who are putting their lives on the line each day to protect and defend members of Congress and our institution. We are incredibly saddened by this loss of life and pray for the injured officer and both of their families. It is difficult to find the right words in times like this. Our @CapitolPolice are our first line of defense and they have been working round the clock for well over a year‚Äîtwo impeachments, protests, COVID, and the insurrection where an officer was killed and two others took their own lives. To lose yet another is a continuing tragedy. I am horrified to hear that a suspect rammed a vehicle into two US Capitol Police officers today, leaving one dead and another injured. üö®üö®SCAM ALERT: @IRSnews warned of a scam primarily targeting college students and staff, or anyone using a "".edu"" email address.

On tribal lands across the U.S., 16% of Native households experience overcrowding, and the figure is double that in Alaska Native villages. .@HUDgov announced $450 million to assist with #COVID19 related tribal housing needs, with more than $64 million going specifically to help Alaska Native communities. https://t.co/Q7tg30xvAV Reminder to Alaskans that the PFD filing deadline is 11:59PM AKDT today.

It‚Äôs essential that the U.S. and Canada find areas of cooperation as to how we can move people safely and securely, and support the countless Alaskan and Canadian communities that rely on each other and this industry. https://t.co/GVJPnA1IvH Alongside @SenDanSullivan I met with Secretary of State @SecBlinken and other top administration officials to speak to the harsh realities of Canada‚Äôs recent cruise ship ban and its impact on our state. https://t.co/jk6EawXKrJ Last month Canada announced a ban on cruise ships traveling through Canadian waters thru February 28, 2022. This is a devastating decision for our state where pre-COVID roughly 60% of Alaska‚Äôs tourism arrived to our state via cruise ships. I also raised a number of Alaska specific issues, including America‚Äôs strategic role in the #Arctic, Canada‚Äôs recent cruise ship ban, the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies, America‚Äôs reliance on foreign production of critical minerals, and US-China trade relations. Alongside @SenDanSullivan I met with Sec. of State @SecBlinken, National Security Advisor @jakejsullivan, &amp; the National Security Council‚Äôs Asia coordinator Kurt Campbell to discuss their recent meetings with China, Japan &amp; South Korea. https://t.co/HMSNSmc1u6 Over the past few years, America has made significant progress in our understanding of carbon removal. New technologies are being developed that can remove carbon dioxide from the air &amp; the oceans in ways we never imagined, and are worthy of federal investment. Proud to join @SenatorSinema in reintroducing the CREATE Act, which will provide support for the development of innovative carbon removal and negative emissions technologies. https://t.co/vtcAXxxMAI Dr. Meusebach Zesch dedicated her life to providing dentistry care for servicemembers, children, disadvantaged individuals, and the most vulnerable. I admire her legacy of grit, bravery and altruism. In Alaska, Dr. Meusebach Zesch traveled by horseback, wagon &amp; by dogsled w/ her mobile dentistry practice to provide care to remote Native villages. On a trip near Cape Douglas, half her dogs fell through the ice &amp; instead of leaving them, she crawled across the ice to save them. Even before statehood, strong women were helping shape Alaska &amp; making major impacts on the lives of others. One of those women was Dr. Leonie von Meusebach Zesch, the 1st woman dentist licensed in the Territory of AK &amp; the 1st female dentist in the @USArmy. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/vxAA3CXVkO I remain committed to supporting the Air Force‚Äôs regional mission of deterrence, vigilance, and defense and will continue to push for further improvements to America‚Äôs posture in the #Arctic. https://t.co/qoqKOgQO2Q This move will also improve access to unparalleled training opportunities at the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex at @EielsonAirForce Base, which provides real-world preparation that is invaluable for our military personnel. I commend the @USAirForce for recognizing Eielson‚Äî&amp; Alaska‚Äôs‚Äîgeostrategic importance. These additional assets will play a significant role supporting the largest concentration of 5th gen aircraft in the world as our military continues to focus on the Indo-Pacific &amp; #Arctic. I welcome the @usairforce's announcement that they will base 4 additional KC-135 Stratotankers at @EielsonAirForce Base, which serves as a critical launch point for America‚Äôs projection of power from Alaska, into the #Arctic, Europe &amp; Indo-Pacific region. https://t.co/GAeQPaC15z It is estimated that the demand for energy across the country could grow nearly 50 percent by the year 2050, making carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies as important as ever in the fight against climate change. #SCALEclimate Proud to join Sen. @ChrisCoons, @SenBillCassidy, @RepVeasey, &amp; @RepMcKinley to introduce the #SCALEAct, which will spur the development of infrastructure needed for large-scale carbon management. https://t.co/MBvTYk80uy During the war she ferried military planes throughout the Lower 48. In 2010 I had the opportunity to present her with a Congressional Gold Medal for her service as a WASP to Alaska and our nation. Her legacy is an inspiration to all Alaskans. https://t.co/r3m03rzkOy Alaska‚Äôs unique history is filled with strong, successful women. Virginia ‚ÄúGinny‚Äù Hill Wood was a respected leader in the Fairbanks community and was well known as one of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) who called Alaska home after WWII. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/TkGozqQ43V Alaskans need to know when to expect clarity, so the hundreds of small businesses that rely on cruise tourism can plan for the upcoming season and economic impact of whatever the guidance states. Today in a Senate HELP Committee hearing focused on the federal response to #COVID19, I questioned CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on the status of updated guidance for the cruise industry ‚Äì which plays an integral role in Alaska‚Äôs economy. https://t.co/NoxPkNdyV1 As of today, around 18.9% of Alaskans are fully vaccinated &amp; 28% have received their first vaccine. With spring around the corner &amp; vaccines rolling out, Alaskans are feeling hopeful. Unfortunately, our economy is still struggling. Currently, @IRSnews has distributed ~90 million Economic Impact Payments from the most recent #COVID19 relief bill. Additional payments will be distributed in the coming weeks. Eligible recipients can learn more about the status of their payment here: https://t.co/9wA7A1R2J8 https://t.co/haaf7t0web Alaska is home to America‚Äôs Arctic Warriors and I look forward to supporting efforts to get our soldiers back to living that mantra in both word and action. #Arctic Tough! https://t.co/Kpzarzi7yM The @USArmy recently released its first-ever strategy for the #Arctic‚ÄîRegaining Arctic Dominance. Their strategy demonstrates the importance of the region and lays out a comprehensive plan to capitalize on the opportunities and challenges in the Arctic‚Äîincluding training. https://t.co/LwtZhE3DPu The FAST Partnership Program is intended to aid disadvantaged, R&amp;D focused small businesses. But over the life of the program, Alaska has consistently ranked at the bottom of the list of states getting awards ‚Äì demonstrating the program is not working for Alaska &amp; other states. I joined @SenatorRisch in introducing the FAST Fix Act, legislation to improve underserved states‚Äô ability to successfully compete for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards. https://t.co/PZhaqlZhP7 It is my hope that @USDOL will work with us on a permanent solution to the challenges seafood companies face in accessing a reliable workforce. During a Senate HELP Cmte hearing to consider the nom of Ms. Julie Su to be @USDOL Deputy Secretary, I brought to her attention that H-2B visas are a priority for Alaska given our significant seasonal workforce, as this is an issue our seafood industry is faced with each year. https://t.co/kDXeOKdKRa The H-2B program is essential for businesses which cannot fill seasonal jobs w/ workers despite intensive recruitment efforts. Ensuring that businesses who rely on a non-immigrant seasonal workers have the workforce necessary to succeed in their operations is paramount. During a Senate Energy Cmte hearing I asked Kelly Speakes-Backman from @Energy what research &amp; development is taking place to lower the cost of hybrid electric ferry conversion as it relates to the Alaska Marine Highway and Alaska's fishing fleets. https://t.co/jarllb0Hib When many Americans think about transportation, they think about roads; however, in Alaska, many communities aren‚Äôt connected to a road system, so when we talk about transportation, much of our focus is on how we travel by waterways or air. https://t.co/oI24PhvXJ7 I applaud @SAMHSAgov‚Äôs recent move to provide nearly $7.3M to Alaska which will increase access to treatment &amp; prevention aid to address mental illness &amp; addiction issues. This is significant support for so many Alaskans struggling with a mental illness or substance use disorder. https://t.co/zVCcxjZkam I recently voted against the American Rescue Plan. There are good, necessary things in the bill that I was able to help shape &amp; influence. Unfortunately, the Democrats‚Äô final product went far beyond #COVID19 relief. For more info on my stance, click below: https://t.co/fXwrJE0Aqw We must continue to bolster the mental health of our healthcare providers as they continue to operate on the frontlines against this pandemic. During the hearing I questioned witnesses on the effectiveness of counteracting the oncoming crisis through the Crisis Now model, which is a framework for expanding behavioral health crisis response - one that has been utilized in Alaska to address the mental health issues. https://t.co/qOufNcl31u I recently took part in a HELP Committee hearing focused on the mental health challenges healthcare professionals have faced in supporting the public health &amp; medical response to COVID, providing care to patients, &amp; distributing &amp; administering #COVID19 medical countermeasures. Our nation is experiencing an additional component of the pandemic‚Äîthe mental and behavioral health impact. There is an urgent need to ensure healthcare providers have access to mental and behavioral health services. https://t.co/RDn5hSgc1n Special thanks to the many volunteers, veterinarians, and health care professionals who made this year‚Äôs race possible, even as we continue to navigate the #COVID19 pandemic. I look forward to following along as the rest of the teams finish their journey. https://t.co/aJXGljBp6f Congratulations to Dallas Seavey and his incredible team of dogs on winning the 2021 Iditarod! Dallas captured his fifth Iditarod win with a time of 7 days, 14 hours, 8 minutes and 57 seconds‚Äîmatching the record for most Iditarod championships. https://t.co/USiCd0Rnkl Thank you to our healthcare workers, the state of Alaska, @IHSgov &amp; so many others for making this incredible accomplishment possible. And, thank you to Alaskans for making it happen. Because of your resilience, we‚Äôre getting through this. This week, Alaska became the first state to remove eligibility requirements for the coronavirus vaccine, making immunization available to anyone 16 and older who lives or works in the state - a truly incredible accomplishment. https://t.co/cA88XNP5Fa I‚Äôm glad to join @SenatorTester in support of legislation to eliminate unnecessary and unexpected annual enrollment fees for certain retired veterans and reduce those fees for individuals and families. https://t.co/N2qCdpARZ7 https://t.co/Kfm3PKashg Alaska is leading the charge in distribution of #COVID19 vaccinations. I‚Äôm proud to have joined my fellow Alaskans in getting vaccinated. There is hope at the end of this long dark tunnel. https://t.co/Nuo9PgEFRa Today, on Ashley Johnson-Barr day, we celebrate a young life, taken far too soon. Her memory is a stark reminder of the importance of our efforts to address sexual assault, domestic violence, and violent crime disproportionately inflicted on Native women &amp; children. #MMIWG https://t.co/Bbvo89tEEX During the #COVID19 public health crisis, violence perpetrated against women and girls has drastically increased around the globe. We have a collective responsibility to safeguard the most vulnerable, particularly during global conflict. I introduced the Keeping Women and Girls Safe from the Start Act of 2021 with @SenatorMenendez ‚Äì a bill to promote a coordinated response to gender-based violence while establishing prevention methods &amp; increasing access to services for survivors. https://t.co/yatumfMOaQ NARA‚Äôs Seattle facility holds irreplaceable records that are invaluable resources for AK‚Äôs Tribes, Tribal organizations, state agencies, universities, teachers, students, &amp; researchers &amp; relocating those records would make it nearly impossible for many Alaskans to access them. The process leading to the proposed sale of the facility under the Federal Assets and Transfer Act (FASTA) was legally flawed &amp; importantly, OMB failed to consult with Tribal governments &amp; organizations in violation of its own Tribal consultation policies. https://t.co/K8uqg3XRvW I, alongside @SenatorCantwell, led the Pacific NW congressional delegations in sending a letter urging OMB to stop the sale of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) facility in Seattle in light of a court decision blocking the sale from proceeding. Special thanks to AK Air National Guard Capt. Lezama of the @176thWing who guided the U.S. military‚Äôs only dedicated combat SAR helicopter through extreme terrain to Newtok, where he evacuated an endangered pregnant woman &amp; transported her to Bethel. https://t.co/6Q4Abm4OyR I was sad to hear that Iditarod icon Aliy Zirkle scratched from the race after being injured in a fall. This was not the way she wanted to finish her last race, but I am glad to know that she is in stable condition and that her dog team is safe. https://t.co/ZxYWT3ozI1 @TheJusticeDept has received reports of fraudulent emails and text messages with links to fake state benefit websites in order to trick those seeking unemployment benefits into disclosing personal information. I encourage everyone to remain vigilant. https://t.co/iJoC4QvzkS During a Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Cmte hearing to consider the nom of David Turk to be Deputy Secretary of @Energy, I questioned Mr. Turk on his commitment to supporting the Arctic Energy Office, &amp; asked what we can do to focus on DOE‚Äôs role as it relates to the #Arctic. https://t.co/xk4phTmeTX In a Senate ENR Cmte hearing to consider the nom of David Turk to be Deputy Secretary of @Energy, I questioned him on his support for projects in Alaska, such as the Makushin geothermal project, &amp; others that will generate clean, affordable energy while reducing carbon emissions. https://t.co/8wogakuvR7 The Energy Act provided new flexibility, eligibility expansion, and transparency for the Title 17 loan program, which will allow the Dept. of @Energy (DOE) to finance large-scale projects and to distribute funds through state-level entities to finance smaller projects. https://t.co/hu8UnTU5eW On #InternationalWomensDay, we celebrate the progress women have made toward gender equality. Today, we are also reminded the push for women's rights is not over. We still have much to achieve. https://t.co/3Hh0VOwwBj One of my all-time favorite events started this weekend in Alaska ‚Äì the #Iditarod! Best of luck to the competitors and their dog teams as they make journey across the Last Frontier. Keep up with their progress here: https://t.co/EyH4S38dNK https://t.co/Rm9ffEObiB My statement after voting against H. R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. https://t.co/bVzBl1RdbY This temporary work-around is a significant step on the path to safely resuming cruise ship activity and economic certainty at a time when Alaskans need it most Canada‚Äôs recent decision to prohibit Alaska-bound cruise ships from operating in Canadian waters creates legal hurdles that will hamstring the Alaska cruise season, creating additional economic strain on Alaska‚Äôs entire economy, especially in our Southeast communities. Alongside @SenDanSullivan I introduced the Alaska Tourism Recovery Act to alleviate the Passenger Vessel Services Act (PVSA) restrictions for cruise ships transporting passengers between the State of Washington and the State of Alaska. https://t.co/sJSoc8yW86 Electronically submitted applications must be uploaded by April 30th, and no late applications will be accepted after the deadlines.

Email AKCares@psmfc.org or call 1-888-517-7262 toll-free for more information. I worked hard with the AK Delegation to ensure Alaska's fisheries received financial support in the previous CARES Act. The application period for fisheries, subsistence &amp; aquaculture relief is open until April 23, so be sure to apply before the deadline. https://t.co/hHjQEqwJIC During an ENR markup today, I announced my support for Rep. Deb Haaland to be Secretary of the Department of the @Interior. Despite some serious misgivings, she has committed to ensuring that all Alaskans have economic opportunities in the state.  https://t.co/q8WZZKcxja https://t.co/PBm9sw8sns The Alaska Native Education Educational Equity Program (ANEP) helps address the unique cultural and educational needs of Alaska Native communities by supporting supplemental education programs that assist Alaska Natives. The @usedgov OESE is seeking peer reviewers who are Alaska Native or have expertise in Alaska Native education to help evaluate applications for the FY21 ANEP grant competition. The deadline to apply has been extended to March 15. Learn more below: https://t.co/BSi8cgPT12 Today I introduced the Nutrition CARE Act w/ @SenCapito &amp; @SenatorHassan, which will improve access to treatment for eating disorders by allowing healthcare professionals to provide medical nutrition therapy services to Medicare beneficiaries. https://t.co/4xrMPgJZw4 Recent studies show that over 30 million Americans experience a clinically significant eating disorder during their lifetime. These complex mental illnesses can have a devastating impact on individuals of all genders and ages. https://t.co/OEEMEzagvq The resolution passed the Senate by Unanimous Consent. With so many active and retired federal employees in Alaska, this resolution re-affirms the importance of honoring NARFE members‚Äô commitment to service across our nation and in the Last Frontier. Proud to cosponsor the resolution w/ @SenatorCardin, @SenatorLankford, Senators @ChrisVanHollen, @TimKaine &amp; @MarkWarner honoring the 100 year anniversary of NARFE, celebrating an organization that represents the federal employees &amp; retirees &amp; who are dedicated to public service. https://t.co/EoWlm2uJkL .@AlaskaHousing is working with many Alaskans around the state on the Alaska Housing Rental Relief program, which is currently accepting applications from Alaskans who are struggling to pay rent/utilities. The deadline to apply is Friday, March 5. https://t.co/CYAS0n0vzR This time-honored competition tests the strength and determination of fierce participants. I will continue to support this storied tradition and celebrate the human and canine participants who uphold our unique traditions as they make their journey across the state. I recently penned an Op-Ed with @SenDanSullivan and @RepDonYoung speaking to the importance of the Iditarod. We must stand up and push back against egregious misinformation and opinionated attacks against the Last Great Race on Earth. https://t.co/ElosCSikXU This bill provides support to those in the emergency room who are often the first line of defense when it comes to suicide prevention. Screening programs are a safe &amp; effective component of suicide prevention efforts, meaning this bill is an opportunity to help save more lives. I‚Äôm proud to once again lead the Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act, bipartisan legislation to improve emergency department mental health screening, assessment, and treatment for individuals at risk of suicide. https://t.co/aL1OVP8LVY In a recent HELP Cmte hearing, I asked Dr. Vivek Murthy, nom to be Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service at @HHSgov, on what more we need to do to address homelessness as a public health issue. https://t.co/4oZRIp6Usk Alaska is a challenging place to be homeless, particularly during the harsh winters. Unfortunately, during #COVID19 we have seen an increase in homelessness in Alaska and I am concerned that trend could continue. https://t.co/MiW78ZL95D In a HELP Cmte hearing, I questioned Dr. Vivek Murthy, nominee to be Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service at @HHSgov, on his commitment to increase access to mental health services. https://t.co/AAR3bBE05p As #COVID19 continues, I am concerned about the negative impacts on our mental health. We‚Äôre seeing rising levels of substance abuse, crisis hotline calls have drastically increased, &amp; we are seeing increased cases of suicide, particularly amongst our children and youth. https://t.co/Ot6cMajjIn It‚Äôs critical that we ensure that Americans struggling with these issues have access to safe, effective, live-saving treatments. Access to care is the key to solving any medical issue‚Äîthe substance-use epidemic is no different. Substance-use disorder and addiction have disproportionately impacted Alaskan communities for far too long. And now, in light of the #COVID19 pandemic, substance-abuse-related mortalities have drastically increased and the opioid public health crisis continues to worsen. I‚Äôm proud to reintroduce the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act with @SenatorHassan, @RepPaulTonko, and @RepMikeTurner, which will expand access to MATs and eliminate barriers to important behavioral health and community-based therapies. https://t.co/dboiNgfdnQ For the USFWS to cast blame on KIC for failing to perform an activity that they were not given explicit authorization to complete is a clear indication that the USFWS had no intention of allowing this process to continue. The USFWS must expeditiously correct this issue. KIC is an Alaska Native Village Corporation seeking to conduct a seismic survey on land it owns within the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Yesterday I issued a statement with @SenDanSullivan &amp; @RepDonYoung rebuking the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (USFWS) for misleading the public on a permitting process with Kaktovik I√±upiat Corporation (KIC). https://t.co/QTWzqH3jl5 Alaskans have been blessed to have had Bud Fate as a friend and leader and one whose life story is woven into our state‚Äôs history. Bud was a role model and a leader for so many Alaskans and one who served his family, his community and his country well. My deepest condolences to his daughters Janine, Jennifer, and Julie, and to my good friend Senator Dan Sullivan, as they mourn the loss of their father. When there was a need to be met, Bud was always willing to help. He &amp; his wife Mary Jane opened their home to those in need and worked together to advance opportunities for Alaska Natives. Bud &amp; Mary Jane were life partners, and the love they shared was reflected in all they did. He used his GI bill to put himself through dental school, was one of the first people to strike oil on the North Slope, and later in life he was elected to the Alaska State Legislature. I was fortunate to serve in the State House with Bud ‚Äì he was truly one of my favorites. I am deeply saddened by the passing of Bud Fate - my friend and a true Alaskan icon. Bud lived a full and incredible life. He served our country as a U.S. Army Veteran who was drafted during the Korean War and later helped map the ALCAN Highway for military use. https://t.co/fQ865uRtMl Whether that is targeting pandemic relief or addressing structural barriers to economic recovery, there are varying needs that Native people are facing throughout the country. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee has always worked to address the needs of the extraordinary diversity of Tribes. I am looking forward to the Committee continuing to do so. I discussed how the Cmte takes seriously the priorities of native communities, which have guided legislation over the years. With strong &amp; unified tribal voices laying out the needs of Indian Tribes, we have seen passage of major pieces of legislation. https://t.co/XG7ArHpz7t Yesterday I convened the @IndianCommittee‚Äôs first hearing for the 117th Congress as Vice Chairman w/ Cmte Chairman @SenBrianSchatz, focusing on the priorities for Native communities in the 117th Congress, &amp; involved native witnesses including @NativeFed President Julie Kitka. This legislation will complement the broader data management approach taken in the BLUE GLOBE Act and help ensure that we capitalize on the many opportunities to strengthen Alaska‚Äôs and America‚Äôs blue economy. It includes a reauthorization for NOAA to carry out ocean exploration from 2021 to 2030. We also authorize funding for an ocean and coastal mapping federal fund. This comprehensive bill is an important complement to the BLUE GLOBE Act‚Äì my bill with @SenWhitehouse to implement a framework that will improve data collection to support the responsible stewardship and economic development of our ocean resources. I‚Äôm proud to join in sponsoring the National Ocean Exploration Act, broad legislation to establish a robust national ocean exploration program designed to advance nationwide priorities for ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization. https://t.co/sCPFW3tWDU https://t.co/oEe43RHyoR During a recent Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing to consider the nomination of U.S. Representative Debra Haaland as Interior Secretary, I questioned Rep. Haaland on her understanding of tribal representation in Alaska and the critical role that ANCs play. https://t.co/wMBmwz4aaU The complex landscape of Alaska Native representation includes the federally recognized tribes, Alaska Native corporations, and Alaska Native regional non-profit organizations. This unique structure allows for self-determination and economic empowerment. This year marks the 50th anniversary of enactment of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). The ANCSA model was created as an alternative to the reservation system used in the Lower 48. She helped draft Alaska‚Äôs Constitution and fought for women‚Äôs rights. I admired her kindness and generosity. My condolences go out to the Hurley family and all those who looked up to Katie. Her life of service was inspiring and Alaska will miss her."
"Murphy, Christopher",ChrisMurphyCT,,Connecticut,Connecticut,Senator," Every time I went to Afghanistan I met with a new general who told me the last general did it wrong and this time was different. I‚Äôm following this closely. Praying for my state. Will pass along news as I learn it. 
https://t.co/wv6Nx52LNs The Endless War cheerleaders have been saying for 15 years that if we just stay in Afghanistan a little longer, the Taliban will give up and the Afghan government will get their act together. And they will say it for the next 15 years if we leave our troops there indefinitely. There is no evidence that our open ended military presence is effective leverage to deliver political stability to Afghanistan. In fact, a 20 year long war (with no end in sight) suggests the opposite is true. It‚Äôs time to bring our troops home. https://t.co/FCc6HzfAKd Did you know there's a special election in Monroe and Newtown today? If you're in the 112th district, I hope you'll get out and vote for Nick Kapoor for State Representative. Polls are open until 8pm. https://t.co/PFxaykpuqj I am requesting a classified briefing on the Natanz incident. It should go without saying that there is no viable military path to divorcing Iran from a nuclear weapon. Only a diplomatic path. And now, the diplomatic road is more difficult. https://t.co/MLlY9pqfzE It's like clockwork:

2008: Russia invades Georgia
2014: Russia invades Ukraine
2021: Russian troops amass on the Ukraine border

The U.S. and Europe, together, must make clear that our security/economic/political partnership with Ukraine is unbreakable. It's not going to stop, until we stop it. https://t.co/bp8sJOf85m FYI there were no negotiations. And just a reminder, here‚Äôs what ‚Äúmaximum pressure‚Äù got us:

-Iran restarted dormant nuclear research
-Iran proxies started attacking our troops again
-our allies abandoned us and tried to help Iran work around our sanctions. 

100% disaster. https://t.co/F9dMRoFQ9N This is a triumphant effort at political revisionism. I was there. Boehner midwifed the Tea Party (the predecessor to the Trump cult) into existence. He nurtured the movement‚Äôs break from truth and tolerance for falsehoods. Maybe he didn‚Äôt intend it to spin out of control, but... https://t.co/bTKfrllw4s Trump and congressional Republicans used their time in power to try to destroy the Affordable Care Act, ending insurance for 20m.

Joe Biden, in his first 100 days, has strengthened the ACA so much that more Americans than ever are signing up. https://t.co/tZDLW15FKk Wow. https://t.co/Z9cSF0CLwO wtf https://t.co/9AHEI498cI The response from government to this cannot be nothing. A 3 year old is dead. Do not let yourself believe this is inevitable. 

And the flow of illegal guns into places like Hartford is made possible by the holes in our background checks system.  https://t.co/y735g4oZec 8/ But the agreement was good for America, Israel, and the rest of the world. It was a sign that diplomacy can solve big problems.

And every day that the U.S. and Iran remain outside the deal, the world is less safe and diplomacy is devalued.
https://t.co/wq4lWhGsn8 7/ Pres Biden shouldn't expect that a single opponent of the original agreement is going to support compliance for compliance. 

Iran, the Gulf states, and congressional Republicans see these talks as a way to do what they couldn't in 2015 - kill any nuclear agreement with Iran. 6/ The best path to getting Iran to the table on non-nuclear issues is to reenter the JCPOA and re-cement the P5+1 alliance structure.

This means ""compliance for compliance"". Iran gets back into accord with the JCPOA and America releases the sanctions.
https://t.co/r2Tm1CGCaT 5/ It is foolhardy to believe that Iran is now willing to sit down and negotiate a comprehensive agreement. And even if they were, they would want concessions from us, like a change to our defense relationship with Saudi Arabia/UAE. 4/ Meanwhile, the alliance Obama had built (U.S/Europe/Russia/China vs. Iran) collapsed. Europe, China, and Russia helped Iran work around Trump's sanctions, and would not cooperate with us on constraining Iran's other destabilizing efforts.
https://t.co/cyXmjRP6qe 3/ We had 4 years to try the approach of the JCPOA opponents. Trump leveled crippling sanctions on Iran to get them to negotiate on everything.

It was a disaster. Iran refused to talk, they restarted their nuclear program, and began firing at U.S. troops.
https://t.co/JRHd17oLpT 2/ The MOST important thing is to make sure Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon. This takes priority. 

Yes, we want Iran to end support for proxies and their missile program. But all their other malevolent activity is much worse if they have a nuclear bomb.
https://t.co/XpCbuhOGFJ I want a ""longer and stronger"" agreement with Iran, but the path to that agreement is through the Iran nuclear deal (the JCPOA). 

1/ A short THREAD on why getting back into the JCPOA, as soon as possible, is the necessary predicate to gain other concessions from Iran. üëáüëáüëá https://t.co/a7uR74p4P5 This tweet was ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù into my feed tonight.

But without congressional action, a quarter of all gun transfers will happen without a check. We need to pass background checks legislation.  https://t.co/mRWGVNAFVe Help me out here. Here‚Äôs how I understand where Republicans are at:

To prove cancelling is bad they are going to cancel people who cancel, because when other people cancel it‚Äôs unacceptable but when the GOP cancels it‚Äôs righteous. 

Do I have this right? I‚Äôm a huge baseball fan. But man it‚Äôs becoming just unwatchable. So few balls in play, turtle like pace, interminable games. 

Sox-Rays game is already 3 hours old and it‚Äôs just 3-1 with two innings to go. 

Fix this please @MLB. The candidate who supported restarting the nuclear agreement got 7 million more votes than the candidate who scuttled it. https://t.co/53cyPc3v3d Very good news.

Highly efficient local efforts like this show why Connecticut‚Äôs vaccination rate is #3 in the nation right now. Go us! https://t.co/0bA3wEcC0W Republicans didn‚Äôt care about ‚Äúwoke corporate virtue signaling‚Äù when corporations‚Äô political speech was giving millions in dark money to elect Republicans. That kind of corporate political action is A-OK I guess. I convened a discussion in Hartford this morning about how a major federal infrastructure bill could benefit Hartford area commuters. A lot of talk about making sure low income commuters are brought into the process. Thanks to @MayorBronin for joining. https://t.co/cK01f95QEj Just mind blowing hypocrisy from the crowd that fought for years to make corporations ‚Äúcitizens‚Äù so they could make First Amendment protected unlimited political contributions. 

Republicans LOOOOVE corporate free speech so long as the corporations agree with Republicans. https://t.co/qARbe2a1Nh It‚Äôs likely 10% of all people buying guns on https://t.co/4CaH7DBI4x are legally prohibited from buying a firearm. 

Why? Because Congress chooses to keep open the loophole that allows sites like armslist to sell guns without a background check.

Heading to Stratford now to talk about how I can use my new chairmanship of the Appropriations subcommittee overseeing FEMA to fund more costal resiliency and protection projects. Then off to New Haven for a meeting on health care. There have been TWENTY mass shootings in America since the Atlanta shooting.

So far in 2021 we are averaging more than one mass shooting a day.

The good news: there is a policy supported by 90% of Americans - expanded background checks - that will stop many of these shootings. Mass Shooting in Orange, California Leaves 4 Dead ‚Äì NBC Los Angeles https://t.co/05UDmeXaVG Yesterday five people were shot in a Washington DC neighborhood. 

Mass shootings happen every day. But when they happen in poor neighborhoods and the victims are Black or Latino, the national news barely covers it.  https://t.co/tq4Lbg1CED Yup. 

100,000 person arenas, $50 million practice facilities, $3 billion TV deals. Players so good they are stars the minute they are allowed to go pro.

This kind of praise a) is going to to go to his head; and b) makes me look real bad. https://t.co/Vxbmsoz9CB So great to catch up with my friend @VP Kamala Harris in New Haven. We had a great conversation at the Boys and Girls Club about how the American Rescue Plan will rescue millions of kids out of poverty. https://t.co/lsjEz1Uqph ‚ÄúStalls‚Äù? The first Senate hearing was 3 days ago. The House passed the bill just 2 weeks ago. No debate has even been scheduled in the Senate. The media should let this play out instead of coming to premature conclusions. https://t.co/meEEmzWjjE If you‚Äôve ever listened to Joe Biden talk about the toll of gun violence, you know that there are few things he cares more about than stopping it. A worthwhile investment. https://t.co/35AxcS3OrY The ‚Äúif you couldn‚Äôt pass gun legislation after Sandy Hook, then it‚Äôs hopeless‚Äù argument is wrong. It‚Äôs all about political muscle. The gun lobby had it in 2013. Our side didn‚Äôt. Now, the anti-gun violence movement is ascending and the NRA is in bankruptcy. https://t.co/Re8YhmzS8i Getting ready for Kamala in Connecticut! So excited to welcome my friend and our Vice President to the state to talk about how the American Rescue Plan is going to help Connecticut's kids. Putting on my sharpest tie! I met with @SenSchumer today and we agreed to spend the next several weeks working with both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to try to craft the strongest background checks bill that can pass. 

Lives are at stake. Failure is not an option. Dunno...the premade turkey pesto sandwich at the carry-out is pretty solid. https://t.co/EwCupoCWt1 That was really weird.

Last night I brought Senators to the floor to read into the record the names of gun violence victims from 2021. https://t.co/s00WBjVqZc Yesterday I went to the floor the tell the truth about what's happening at the border, and to explain how Joe Biden is doing the right thing by applying the law with humanity. Give it a watch. https://t.co/XzHEqMe6IY Booker made it. He has the floor now. Tune in. https://t.co/UoLgXtGFRI Right now @Bob_Casey has the floor. https://t.co/hduoB9pjbz Thanks @amyklobuchar for joining us on the floor to read into the record the names of those lost in 2021 from gun violence. https://t.co/7feGciLeiz Right now @SenCortezMasto has the floor, reading the names of victims of gun violence. More Senators arriving on the floor soon. Powerful testimony. https://t.co/7feGciLeiz cc @SenBlumenthal Please turn on @cspan right now. @MichaelBennet talking about Boulder. From his heart. Hey @CoryBooker the last week has been brutal. But so has all of 2021.

We need people to understand what we‚Äôve lost to gun violence. What if read into the Senate record the names of those we‚Äôve lost?

Heading to the floor now. Hoping colleagues can join. Republicans aren‚Äôt telling the truth about what‚Äôs happening at the border. I was there last week and I‚Äôm heading to the Senate floor now to tell the real story and explain how America can both uphold the rule of law and act with compassion
https://t.co/bQJ4IsUJ29 Sen. Murphy: Inaction makes Congress ‚Äòcomplicit‚Äô in mass shootings  https://t.co/w2RoHpv48m Don't get hypnotized by small differences between Senate Democrats on background checks policy. They can be bridged.

The barrier to passage isn't Democrats. It's Republicans. The media often laments that ""nothing has changed"" since Newtown. That's not true. Dozens of states have strengthened their guns laws, through legislation and referendum. Congrats on the movement's latest success in Maryland. https://t.co/Ei3SFAZcNm ‚ÄúSo have Biden administration policies caused a crisis at the southern border? Evidence suggests not.‚Äù https://t.co/BMVLUrikPs Yes. https://t.co/sOrt0ugtkx For 5 years McConnell refused to put a background checks bill up for a vote because he knew that many of his members, forced to choose between the fading gun lobby and rising anti-gun violence movement, would side w the latter. 

Don‚Äôt assume background checks can‚Äôt get 60 votes. Talking w @andersoncooper on @CNN in a minute about the work to reform our gun laws. Tune in. Often our sanctions do more harm than good. 

For example, Trump‚Äôs eleventh hour move to sanction diesel fuel in Venezuela just hurts poor people. It leads to starvation with no practical impact on the Maduro regime. 

My strong recommendation is that it be rescinded. https://t.co/qOor08mDkw So exciting to welcome the Vice President to New Haven! https://t.co/Pt2MeRiete I was more of a ‚Äúcheer from the bench‚Äù specialist during my high school basketball career.

üè† home and community based services

Why? Because they are all necessary for people to work, live, and be productive. The¬†rise in¬†hates crimes against Asian-Americans is absolutely unacceptable. We have to take action¬†&amp; condemn this violence‚Äîand that starts by passing @maziehirono‚Äôs COVID‚Äì19 Hate Crimes Act. There's no reason¬†and no excuse¬†not¬†to vote for this bill. #StopAsianHate Reversing the Trump-Pence #TitleX gag rule is a game-changer for the millions of patients whose access to health care was threatened by their dangerous rule‚Äî&amp; will help ensure patients can get the care they need from the providers they trust. As we build back from this pandemic, we cannot settle for an economy that forces workers to choose between their health &amp; their paycheck. We must demand better, and my bill with @rosadelauro will help us do that. https://t.co/ScrRf5tvwP There are many things you can do after you're fully vaccinated but also still precautions you should take‚Äîlike wearing a mask and social distancing.

That's unacceptable‚Äîand @rosadelauro and I are working to fix it with legislation that would establish a national paid sick days policy. Paid sick days are critical for¬†the health and economic security of¬†workers, families, and our country‚Äîa fact made clearer by this pandemic.

@rosadelauro and I have been pushing for a national paid sick days policy, and we have a bill to get it done. https://t.co/ScrRf5tvwP Medication abortion is essential, time-sensitive care‚Äîincluding during a pandemic.

That means roads &amp; bridges‚Äîbut it also means child care, paid leave, &amp; caring for older Americans &amp; people w/disabilities.

Today I talked w/ housing providers in Seattle about the challenges they‚Äôre facing and how the American Rescue Plan‚Äôs funding for housing &amp; homelessness relief will help. https://t.co/DYfHMCCiwK There has been an alarming rise of domestic violence and sexual assault incidents during the pandemic. Spread the word about the resources available to survivors so they can seek the support they need. #SAAM https://t.co/REvATM4FOd In the same way we need roads, we need¬†to invest in a¬†caregiving infrastructure that ensures¬†people w/ disabilities¬†and older Americans¬†can live independently &amp;¬†home care workers get the wages &amp; benefits they deserve‚Äîwhich the American Jobs Plan would do. https://t.co/ILJ8hYa3Ii The American Rescue Plan is helping us get more vaccines into arms faster.¬†Starting April 15th, everyone over the age of 16 in WA state is eligible for a vaccine and can schedule an appointment through @WADeptHealth. https://t.co/WN17AiOEP9 The American Rescue plan includes significant tax relief for working families in Washington state and across the country.

Click below to learn more about what‚Äôs available and if you qualify. https://t.co/zG907aOVYz We must¬†continue doing¬†everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19. That means wearing masks, social distancing, washing our hands, getting tested if you have symptoms,¬†&amp;¬†getting vaccinated as soon as you can.¬†We can‚Äôt¬†let¬†our guard down now. I‚Äôm committed to ensuring our judicial branch better reflects our country‚Äî&amp; that starts with a diverse group of legal experts on the selection committee who'll help me fill federal court vacancies¬†w/ those who have experience representing everyday people. https://t.co/GdPyohciLl We‚Äôve seen health inequities undermine our response and hurt communities of color during this pandemic. Today, I spoke with public health experts from across WA about how the American Rescue Plan will help address health and vaccine inequity and the challenges that lay ahead. https://t.co/EHXUNt57on President Biden's American Jobs Plan lays out a strong path for rebuilding our economy by investing first and foremost in the workers, families, and communities who keep our country running‚Äîrather than in huge corporations.

Read my full statement here: https://t.co/ISXDWjODAm I had a great call with small business owners &amp; leaders from Spokane. Conversations like yesterday's help me bring the voices of WA‚Äôs small businesses to Congress, &amp; they were important as I fought to get small businesses much-needed relief in the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/x6FFCT4fEl To wrap up #WomensHistoryMonth, I joined the Democratic women of WA‚Äôs Congressional delegation to share how we got started in politics, what inspires us, and more.

One thing we‚Äôve all seen firsthand is that when you use your voice &amp; stand together‚Äîyou can make a difference. https://t.co/PlIBiBbGrA To the trans community: I see you‚Äîand I will fight for you to¬†ensure equal protection¬†under the law, and against the bigoted attacks on the entire community‚Äîin particular trans youth‚Äîtaking place in states across the country. #TransDayOfVisibility The results of real-world tests of our authorized vaccines have reinforced what we already knew‚Äîthese vaccines are safe and effective. To keep yourself &amp; your family safe, you should get one when it‚Äôs your turn. https://t.co/NP2CeArSXV I‚Äôm glad @CDCgov¬†is taking critical steps to help people stay in their homes as this pandemic continues. https://t.co/PECWhpNMeI By April 19th, over 90% of Americans will be eligible to get vaccinated‚Äî&amp;¬†they‚Äôll¬†be able to do so¬†within 5 miles of their home. This is great news in our fight to end this pandemic, but it‚Äôs not over yet¬†as variants spread. We must remain vigilant to keep communities safe. https://t.co/Eu3hpUcNnm Doctors in WA state and across the country have stepped up time and time again this past year. They sacrificed so much to help keep their neighbors &amp; communities safe. I'm forever grateful for their work, and I know countless other families are too. #NationalDoctorsDay Our nation is forever grateful to the Vietnam veterans &amp; their families who sacrificed so much for our nation. Thank you.

#NationalVietnamWarVeteransDay https://t.co/zrbyCIbjO2 Even if you‚Äôve previously had COVID-19, it‚Äôs¬†important to get vaccinated when it‚Äôs your turn. Get the facts from @CDCGov. https://t.co/2SjksHToe7 When a sexual assault survivor goes to a hospital, they deserve compassion, respect, and access to sexual assault examinations critical to their ability to get justice. But that‚Äôs often not the case. No survivor seeking care should be turned away‚Äîand my bill will help fix that. https://t.co/JGew8izMl6 ICYMI: Help is here from the American Rescue Plan.

Check out my new webpage that details the support¬†that‚Äôs on the way for¬†families, workers, college students, small businesses, and more. https://t.co/IQ7CHkTYqn I've always fought for policies that ensure Americans feel that there‚Äôs a place for them and allows them to work and take care of their families at the same time‚Äîand I'm proud to have @rosadelauro as a partner in that work. https://t.co/xV5VxgMLqU Pfizer.¬†Moderna. Johnson &amp; Johnson. The science is clear on all 3 authorized vaccines‚Äîthey‚Äôre safe &amp; effective, and made possible due to the hard work of thousands of scientists, decades of research, &amp; thorough clinical trials. As our economy begins to recover, we need to make sure workers and families can get to where they need to go. My new bill would invest in our public transportation infrastructure, including light-rail projects in Washington state. https://t.co/HKsqgNMddT Today, millions of people who depend on government-sponsored health plans have the right to an abortion in name only‚Äîbut not in practice. It's absolutely unacceptable. Passing the EACH Act would help ensure all patients can exercise their right to an abortion. Good news‚Äîyou now have until May 17th¬†to file your taxes. https://t.co/poDcVwhX9W Remember¬†to wear a mask to help protect yourself, your loved ones, and those in your community. #MaskUpWA https://t.co/iWMn8FskGA To me, the question cannot be what Senate process Republicans use to limit Americans‚Äô voices in our democracy. It should be, why do they want to stop voters from voting? Clearly, if Senate Republicans use the filibuster to limit voters‚Äô rights, it is time to look at an exemption to the filibuster in order to protect our democracy. Recent events, including the Jan. 6th insurrection where brute force was used to try to override votes, &amp; current efforts in states to limit in unprecedented ways peoples‚Äô access to the polls, mean we must use every tool to fight back and assure our democracy remains strong. Our democracy depends on peoples‚Äô participation. The essence of that is having all Americans use their voices‚Äîby voting. Here are some more of my thoughts on the statement I made yesterday about the #ForThePeopleAct and the filibuster: Helping families get quality, affordable health coverage is always the right move.¬†I‚Äôm glad¬†@POTUS¬†recognizes this and has extended the federal open enrollment period to August 15.¬†If you live in a state on the Federal exchange,¬†get started at¬†https://t.co/TWIHimmWhs https://t.co/z0ItsK0QqS The historic investments¬†in the American Rescue Plan¬†will cut child poverty in half‚Äîmeaning millions of children will have the security of a roof over their head and food on table.¬†This is a game changer for so many families. I'm working to support Hanford workers and those at other nuclear clean-up sites with legislation to ensure they can obtain the full benefits they‚Äôre entitled to when they‚Äôre exposed to toxic substances at the workplace. https://t.co/wVc8afgQMP Now that the American Rescue Plan is law, it‚Äôs important to me that families, workers, small businesses, students, Tribes, and all our communities know how to get the relief they need as quickly and easily as possible‚Äî&amp; I hope my new webpage will help:¬†https://t.co/IQ7CHkTYqn This week alone, I‚Äôve introduced three long-overdue¬†bills¬†to help women¬†get the¬†health care¬†they need. And there‚Äôs more to come.
¬†
After four years of¬†fighting against backward policies that hurt women‚Äôs health,¬†we‚Äôre moving forward. Washington state is making progress towards getting everyone vaccinated‚Äîwhich is an essential part of ending this pandemic. Make sure to get vaccinated when it‚Äôs your turn. https://t.co/r1xCX9vGAv Patients‚Äîin particular women of color‚Äîare dying from breast and gynecologic¬†cancers because they don't have access to preventive health care.¬†I¬†re-introduced¬†legislation¬†in honor of¬†Jeanette Acosta¬†that would address these troubling disparities. https://t.co/R6TUslPwpb Contact tracing helps us stop the spread of COVID-19 in Washington state¬†and across the country. It‚Äôs so important that you answer the call. https://t.co/4ekLEEbJKl Over half of the¬†women¬†of reproductive age¬†enrolled in Medicaid are women of color. The¬†EACH¬†Act¬†would end¬†the federal restriction¬†on Medicaid coverage of abortion &amp; help ensure every patient can get the reproductive health care they need, regardless of race or¬†zip code. I joined @maziehirono and others to say we must take steps right now to keep members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities safe and send a message that violence and hate crimes against these communities must stop immediately. https://t.co/2gCL5cbBx8 Vaccines must get to communities of color, people w/¬†disabilities, rural communities, people whose first language isn't English, &amp; those who lack¬†internet¬†access. Glad @POTUS is using funds from the American Rescue Plan to make sure¬†vaccines reach *every* community. https://t.co/lOHgtWlFZf https://t.co/srMnQion68 Abortion is critical to a person‚Äôs health and ability to live the life they choose‚Äîbut too often, it‚Äôs only available to those who have the means.

We can fix this with our bill to end abortion coverage restrictions for those who depend on government-sponsored health care plans. Marco Rubio and I may not agree on much, but we do agree on this: permanent daylight saving time.

I'm all in on getting this done. https://t.co/zkqzCy4DEp The history of health inequities in this country is a long and painful one, and comprehensive action is well overdue. We must take steps to not only address the inequities of this pandemic‚Äîbut to root inequity out of the health care system altogether. Even as communities of color face more deaths &amp; hospitalizations from COVID-19, they‚Äôre still getting vaccinated at lower rates than their white peers. The picture painted by the data so far is grim‚Äî&amp; despite improvements, that picture is still incomplete. We‚Äôve got to fix that. The reality of health inequities is that how you live‚Äîand even whether you live or die in a pandemic‚Äîis impacted by your race, income, zip code, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, and more. When we talk about inequities, we are talking about the reality that people‚Äôs health suffers because of systemic issues, like how far they are from quality, affordable, accessible, and culturally competent care. LIVE: I'm chairing today‚Äôs HELP Committee hearing on how we can address the health inequities that have made this pandemic so much more deadly for some communities than others. https://t.co/SLGCzGXeKs I introduced new legislation that would require local Tribes¬†be consulted before the sale of the Seattle Archives, which houses critical pieces of their history¬†and provides key services, effectively halting current efforts to sell the facility. https://t.co/XgufN9R866 The people in our government should reflect the people it serves. Today, we took a new, historic step toward making that a reality with the confirmation of Dr. Rachel Levine. https://t.co/HWtuyHV0Gs I spoke on the Senate floor today about the historic nomination of @SecretaryLevine to serve as Assistant Secretary of @HHSGov. She's a highly-qualified public health expert whose knowledge &amp; experience will be critical as our nation works to end this pandemic. https://t.co/r7hU1qpUL2 .@SecretaryLevine¬†has been on the frontlines of this pandemic, which is why she knows firsthand what our states and communities need from @HHSGov¬†to address the challenges ahead and end it. Glad her historic nomination¬†was confirmed today¬†so she can get to work. https://t.co/EJ9Qvrx1gW It‚Äôs so important to prioritize your mental health. If you‚Äôre looking for help or need someone to talk to amid the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Washington Listens support line is free and anonymous. Call 1-833-681-0211. It is ridiculous that in 2021, women still don‚Äôt receive equal pay for equal work. We‚Äôve got to close the wage gap once and for all‚Äîand that starts by passing the #PaycheckFairness Act. RT if you agree. #EqualPayDay I‚Äôm chairing the Senate HELP Committee as we consider the nomination of Cindy Marten to serve as Deputy Secretary of @usedgov.

Join us live. https://t.co/iCh8YnEEAF For years, Democrats have pushed for action to stop senseless killings caused by gun violence, with commonsense reforms that will save lives.

For years, we‚Äôve been blocked by Republican leaders and their special interests.

Now, we can act‚Äîand we will. https://t.co/SWhM2W4LIb Thanks to @leahegriffin's bravery in sharing her experience surviving sexual assault &amp; struggling to get care, we're working to fix the system that failed her &amp; so many others. I'm grateful for her tireless advocacy &amp; will keep working to ensure survivors get the care they need. https://t.co/Fkxg02wVV2 .@BobbyScott &amp; I are leading the charge to get rid of the unfair, anti-worker rule at EEOC that has made it easier for employers to delay or deny workers justice when they've experienced discrimination on the job. https://t.co/QXqEExK2X5 .@Vivek_Murthy is a highly experienced, crisis-tested leader and an excellent choice to return as Surgeon General. Glad he was confirmed today‚Äîand I‚Äôm looking forward to working with him to address this pandemic and the underlying health inequities it has made way worse. https://t.co/z72lUIBijf https://t.co/gWdrVUfNix The unfair, anti-worker EEOC rule was designed to tip the scales in favor of employers when workers try to make sure their rights on the job are enforced. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason it should stay on the books. I'm working to restore a fair process where workers can be heard. Survivors of sexual assault deserve to be able to go to a hospital¬†&amp;¬†get compassionate, experienced care from a trained provider‚Äî&amp; a commitment to helping them get justice.¬†My bipartisan bill with @LisaMurkowski &amp; @RepJayapal will¬†help¬†ensure survivors get the support they need. For¬†many survivors of sexual assault, it‚Äôs an extremely difficult choice to disclose their assault &amp; seek justice. We need to do everything we can to¬†make sure that when survivors¬†seek care, they aren‚Äôt turned away‚Äîand that‚Äôs what my bill will do. https://t.co/6ppmJ6yIX8 We can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but this pandemic isn‚Äôt over yet. Don‚Äôt forget to wear a mask, wash your hands,¬†practice social distancing, get tested for COVID-19¬†if you‚Äôre experiencing symptoms, and get vaccinated when it‚Äôs your turn. 11¬†years later, the Affordable Care Act has helped millions of working families get health care‚Äîand¬†the American Rescue Plan¬†builds on that work to¬†lower premiums and help millions more get, and keep, quality affordable coverage. What happened in Boulder yesterday is a tragedy‚Äîand unfortunately it‚Äôs one that‚Äôs all too common in our country.

The best way to honor these victims &amp; their families is to pass commonsense gun legislation without delay. Click the link below for information about COVID-19 vaccines from @CDCgov based on its recommendations for specific groups of people‚Äîincluding essential workers, older adults, &amp; people with disabilities. https://t.co/PuU0LTyAeB As a champion for workers and working families, @MartyJWalsh is exactly the person we need leading @USDOL. I look forward to working with him to build a stronger, fairer economy that works for everyone‚Äînot just those on top. https://t.co/9FtqtyJNmV Today marks the 7th anniversary of the Oso mudslide that killed 43 people &amp; hurt so many nearby communities. I‚Äôm thinking of the people of Oso, Darrington, &amp; Arlington today &amp; I'm reminded of how Washington's communities can come together in the face of adversity. #OsoStrong The COVID-19 pandemic worsened housing inequities in Tribal communities‚Äîand new funding from the American Rescue Plan will help tackle this head-on while building back to a stronger, fairer economy that works for everyone. https://t.co/NeqZRD4Hbh Like @VP said, we all want to get back to normal after this crisis‚Äîlike hugging our grandkids &amp; visiting out of town family. But we must recognize that normal wasn‚Äôt working for so many families. The American Rescue Plan will help us build back fairer &amp; stronger for everyone. https://t.co/q2EU6vG2CA It‚Äôs time we give the over 700,000 residents of our nation‚Äôs capital a voice by finally making #DCStatehood a reality. https://t.co/03ZIFVozBw We can't settle for an economy that forces workers of color, who are less likely to have access to paid leave, to choose between their health and their paycheck. We can and must demand more. https://t.co/EbYIl9EfQf If you‚Äôre struggling to keep food on the table, make next month‚Äôs rent, or have lost your job amidst this pandemic, the American Rescue Plan is here to help. Violent acts against Washington state‚Äôs Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, while unfortunately not new for so many, have become increasingly common during the pandemic. This needs to end, and the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act is a first step to ensure accountability. All 3 authorized vaccines‚ÄîPfizer, Moderna, and J&amp;J‚Äîare safe and incredibly effective. Each one is shown to prevent hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. Keep yourself safe and help end this pandemic by getting vaccinated when it‚Äôs your turn. The alarming rise of domestic violence during this pandemic has made it¬†even¬†more urgent that we close the dangerous loophole that allows abusers¬†&amp;¬†stalkers to obtain firearms. We owe it to women &amp; families to pass¬†legislation that strengthens protective orders. https://t.co/d6pyI5vqG5 I firmly believe that we won‚Äôt recover as a country from this crisis until all of us recover.¬†I‚Äôll continue working‚Äîjust like I did with the American Rescue Plan‚Äîto make sure everyone in Washington State gets the help they need¬†to get through this pandemic¬†&amp; come out stronger. https://t.co/OIUMIT1fLx Good news for anyone who needs quality, affordable health care for their family: now through May 15, people in Washington state can browse, change, and enroll in coverage for 2021. https://t.co/VpIwaM42Mw The American Rescue Plan was written with working families in mind. That‚Äôs why it includes:

üíµ Direct payments
üè´ Support for schools and child care
üíâ Funding for vaccine distribution and administration
‚ûï And so much more Stay informed about COVID-19 in your area, including a county-by-county risk assessment, with @WADeptHealth's dashboards. https://t.co/Y7BW1dYVig I want to get our kids back to the classroom safely and as quickly as possible. The American Rescue Plan will help get this done by making sure schools can secure adequate PPE, reduce class sizes to increase social distancing, improve ventilation, address learning loss, and more. Students and parents have suffered tremendously as a result of this pandemic‚Äîand we know this pain has not been felt equally as the crisis has deepened existing inequities in our education system. We wrote the American Rescue Plan so it would help¬†*all*¬†our kids. More and more Americans are getting vaccinated every single day‚Äîand the American Rescue Plan will help us¬†continue to¬†increase the number of vaccinations and end this pandemic. https://t.co/aFcZefMLzV The American Rescue Plan will deliver needed resources to Tribal communities in WA state &amp; across the country to help ensure they can weather this storm. https://t.co/QmzwxAK6IC Thank goodness. The Trump Admin‚Äôs #TitleX gag rule made it harder for millions of patients to get health care they needed from providers they trust. #FixTitleX https://t.co/owJz1NJ3OT Across Washington state and the nation, there are vital public transit projects on the chopping block due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I¬†introduced a bill to provide relief for public transportation agencies¬†&amp; invest in a world-class public transit system. https://t.co/l7RBiBve63 This pandemic has been all the more deadly for communities of color due to longstanding health inequities. The American Rescue Plan makes addressing equity a¬†priority, and I'm going to keep working with @POTUS to make progress here. https://t.co/8cbTdWIZKf WA state will receive ~$230M in federal funding for COVID-19 testing for schools &amp; to close gaps in testing &amp; contact tracing in underserved communities. These resources will help get kids back in the classroom safely &amp; ensure equity in our response. https://t.co/0OcmW7aDA8 For absolutely no good reason, former Secretary DeVos denied the majority of student loan borrowers who were defrauded or cheated the loan forgiveness they deserved. Thank you, @SecCardona and the Biden Administration, for making this necessary change. https://t.co/McKUj2khTD As one of the senators who helped write the American Rescue Plan, I made sure Washington state families were heard and that they will get direct, targeted relief. Read more about the help that‚Äôs on the way in my @SoSeaEmerald op-ed. https://t.co/d0psHEdnyd It's simple: wear a mask to protect yourselves &amp; those around you‚Äîand to help end this pandemic. https://t.co/vRJKkqMDBo The road to recovery is still long,¬†&amp;¬†there are still many steps we¬†have to¬†take.¬†I¬†hope my colleagues¬†join me in voting to confirm @MartyJWalsh‚Äîsomeone¬†we can trust to stand up for workers¬†and¬†not huge corporations‚Äîto help us get there. In his testimony to the Senate HELP Committee, Mayor Walsh spoke powerfully about the importance of protecting the frontline workers who do so much to keep our communities¬†&amp;¬†our country running, and¬†rooting out the inequities that have done so much damage to communities of color. As¬†a union leader, a state representative, and a¬†mayor, @MartyJWalsh has always¬†stood up for workers.¬†He¬†has a clear track record as a collaborative leader who worked across coalitions‚Äîwith labor groups and the business community‚Äîto build up Boston‚Äôs middle class. This pandemic has laid bare the painful fact that while our economy might work for the biggest corporations and wealthiest individuals,¬†it doesn‚Äôt work for working families.¬†We need someone¬†like @MartyJWalsh at @USDOL who will actually champion workers and working families. Even before this pandemic, the deck was stacked against workers‚Äîand especially against women, workers of colors,¬†and workers with disabilities‚Äîthanks to policies that haven‚Äôt prioritized¬†working people. I‚Äôm speaking on the Senate floor to¬†urge the Senate to¬†confirm¬†the nomination of Mayor¬†@MartyJWalsh¬†to serve as Secretary of @USDOL. https://t.co/SmTHi5ecx9 I‚Äôm glad the Senate has confirmed @HHSGov Secretary @XavierBecerra, he's exactly the leader we need at the Department during this critical time. I look forward to working with him to end this pandemic and get quality affordable health care to more working families. https://t.co/6J5j9JRUtq We all want to make sure we learn from this moment in our history‚Äîbecause we owe it to every American who has suffered, or who is grieving, after this past year to make sure we never find ourselves here again. Testing.
Contact tracing.
Vaccine distribution¬†and administration.
Fighting disinformation.
Recruiting public health workers.
Addressing health inequalities.
Building back stronger and¬†fairer.

The American Rescue Plan makes critical investments in all this and more. While we aren‚Äôt through this pandemic yet‚Äîwe are¬†starting to¬†see the light at the end of the tunnel. But we‚Äôre going to have to keep pushing to make sure we get there. Whether it‚Äôs public health guidance,¬†listening to the experts, testing, or getting vaccines into arms‚Äîthe results are clear: under @POTUS,¬†efforts are on track and¬†help is on the way. We‚Äôve seen a lot of change¬†since¬†our first¬†COVID-19 hearing with federal officials over a year ago.¬†The difference between how President Biden has been handling this crisis, &amp;¬†how former President Trump refused to is staggering.

For *knocking on Gov. Kemp‚Äôs office door* as she tried to observe the cowardly closed-door signing ceremony for the voter suppression law. https://t.co/hpp6ZQxo2r Tonight Georgia‚Äôs legislature passed a bill brazenly intended to make it harder for Georgians to vote.

Among its outrageous provisions: it criminalizes *giving water to voters who are waiting in line.*

It‚Äôs no wonder Gov. Kemp hid behind closed doors while he signed it. üëçüëç We just passed this extension of the PPP small business lending program through May.

This is big news for Georgia‚Äôs small businesses.

https://t.co/ySltkELFj4 We all need to sound the alarm on what‚Äôs happening in Georgia. 

#SB202 is not about securing our elections ‚Äî it‚Äôs about suppressing Black voters and keeping the Big Lie alive.

This #EqualPayDay, we must recommit to ending pay discrimination and closing the gender pay gap.

@SenFeinstein and I are calling for California's authority to set vehicle emissions standards to be restored because everyone deserves clean air to breathe. https://t.co/lTIy6BGXRG I‚Äôm on the Senate floor speaking on why we must pass the #ForThePeople Act to protect the right to vote and save our democracy. Watch live: https://t.co/AzK52GhHLO In the 11 years since passing, the ACA has transformed our health care system by:

‚û°Ô∏è Expanding coverage to &gt;20m Americans
‚û°Ô∏è Protecting those with pre-existing conditions 
‚û°Ô∏è Expanding Medicaid

We must keep fighting to protect &amp; expand health care until it is guaranteed to all. It should not be easier to buy a gun than it is to cast a ballot. There couldn‚Äôt be a more clear call to action to end gun violence. I‚Äôm joining @JudiciaryDems in discussing commonsense gun safety reforms. Watch live: https://t.co/4T46hue6C0 My heart breaks for the Boulder community and the families of the victims in yet another tragic shooting.

We must remember that we are not powerless. We need to act now to end gun violence. https://t.co/kXRWbCptoX Voter suppression and the filibuster are both rooted in white supremacy. To save our democracy and our country, we must end both. Thank you to everyone for their kind birthday wishes today. Reflecting on this past year, I really do have a lot to be grateful for ‚Äî including this surprise in the office today. My staff knows me well! ‚öæÔ∏è https://t.co/i3ewBwlBO4 The ability to access COVID care should never depend on immigration status. 

Proud to join @SenatorBennet in urging @POTUS to ensure that everyone‚Äîincluding undocumented immigrants‚Äîcan receive COVID testing, treatment &amp; vaccines without worrying about how they'll pay for them. https://t.co/vxr6G4dLmC Continuing to deny Washington, D.C. a vote in Congress means denying full representation to the Black and Brown voters who make up a majority in our nation‚Äôs capital.

@SenFeinstein &amp; I are calling on @POTUS to restore CA's authority to set clean car standards while improving national standards. https://t.co/xJHjaT1BPg The #EqualityAct isn‚Äôt just about tolerance. It‚Äôs about respect. It‚Äôs about letting children be who they are. It‚Äôs about letting their parents love who they love. It‚Äôs about affirming the words carved above the Supreme Court of the United States: equal justice under law. Since Citizens United, dark money and super PACs have polluted our political system. We‚Äôre going to end this corruption with the #ForThePeople Act and get dark money OUT of our elections. Congratulations to @RWCLibrary for being named a finalist for the nation‚Äôs highest service award for libraries and museums! In the face of a pandemic, their efforts to help educate and serve their community have never been more critical. They make California proud. https://t.co/qI7Zi3wjEV Happy #Nowruz to everyone celebrating the arrival of Spring in California and around the world. May the spirit of Nowruz bring hope, peace, and good health to you and your family! Let's be clear: immigration status does not impact vaccine eligibility.
 
No one should be asked about their citizenship or immigration status when they get a vaccine.

COVID has exposed the stark contrast between those with access to Wi-Fi &amp; the luxury of Zooming in to work and those who must put their lives at risk working on farms, at grocery stores, in construction, or at hospitals. We must continue to address these inequities. https://t.co/HLukaXZGvY Thinking of those whose lives were stolen in the Atlanta shooting:

They were friends, parents, partners, and neighbors. We must say and know their names. Congratulations to Jesse Magdaleno who, through his hard work and dedication to his community, has received the Boys and Girls Club's Coastal California Youth of the Year award. I have no doubt that he will go on to accomplish great things. Adelante! https://t.co/M7w9WgEpkO Last month, I received the COVID-19 vaccine.

#ThrowbackThursday https://t.co/O7ffzhU8Ao Big news: the Dream &amp; Promise Act and the Farm Workforce Modernization Act both passed the House today with bipartisan support. 

This lays the foundation for a pathway to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants who call America home. Let's keep up this momentum. Thank you @RepGraceMeng for your powerful testimony in today's @HouseJudiciary hearing on anti-Asian hate &amp; discrimination. I stand with you not just in solidarity, but in action to help our Asian American &amp; Pacific Islander community feel seen, heard, and safe in this country. https://t.co/3sYG9yrraJ Electrifying our public transportation system will create nearly a million jobs, help modernize our crumbling infrastructure, and fight the climate crisis. That‚Äôs good for everyone, and why I am proud to join @SenWarren, @SenMarkey, @RepAOC &amp; @RepAndyLevin on the #BuildGreen Act. https://t.co/O51GxPXuWf Congratulations to my friend @XavierBecerra on his confirmation as our nation's top public health official‚Äîthe first Latino to serve in the role. 

I know he's ready to get to work to protect health care for millions, tackle structural inequities, and help defeat this pandemic. https://t.co/sPZtipdOtZ During the pandemic alone, @StopAAPIHate has received nearly 3,800 reports of hate incidents against Asian Americans.
 
We must fight the dangerous rhetoric fueling this surge in bigotry &amp; violence and reform the systems upholding it. We must pass the #COVID19 Hate Crimes Act. The American Rescue Plan will help California beat this crisis by putting shots in arms, money in pockets, children in schools, and people in jobs.
https://t.co/XVGYVDymcX As the first Latinos in our respective positions, @XavierBecerra &amp; I are not unfamiliar with being held to different standards. That's what the cynical delays and political games around his nomination have been about.

It‚Äôs time to let him get to work. I am on the Senate floor speaking about why we must confirm @XavierBecerra, a proven leader and champion for equity, as our next HHS Secretary. Watch live: https://t.co/WDos3aZz9U Congratulations @SenatorWarnock on a wonderful first floor speech on the importance of protecting the sacred right to vote &amp; the urgent need for the Senate to take action. I look forward to working together to ensure every voice is heard in our democracy. https://t.co/h0rAvm8Ehp Let‚Äôs call polices like ending no excuse absentee voting &amp; limiting weekend voting what they are: voter suppression. We must fight these injustices &amp; pass the John Lewis #VotingRightsAct to expand access to the ballot box &amp; #ProtectTheVote. @SenWarren Thank you, @SenWarren. It is an honor to work with you on my first bill in the Senate and fight alongside you to make our country and democracy work better for America's working families. It has been two decades since Congress last took significant action to improve our elections‚Äîwe can't wait any longer. The fate of our democracy rests on our ability to protect voting rights for all citizens. That's why we're introducing the #ForthePeople Act in the Senate today. The Senate is holding its first-ever hearing on the #EqualityAct right now. Watch live below: https://t.co/ctlMSAldKk I am horrified and heartbroken by the shooting last night in Atlanta. My heart is with the victims, their loved ones, and the AAPI community.

Enough is enough. We must take action to #StopAsianHate. Millions of immigrant essential workers have been called heroes throughout the pandemic. It's time to thank them with more than just our words.

Looking forward to my conversation with @CHIRLA in a few minutes‚Äîtune in on my Instagram: https://t.co/a9hLIHPkns The environmental crises we face demand more than simply scaling up our current efforts.
 
That's why I'm joining @RepRaulGrijalva, @RepJoeNeguse, @SenBlumenthal, &amp; @SenatorLujan in advocating for @POTUS to work with communities to decide how to preserve American lands &amp; waters. https://t.co/sgnyHdp0ur Yesterday, the son of Mexican immigrants from a working-class town in California rose to speak on the floor of the U.S. Senate. While this is my story, it is not unique to me‚Äîit is the American Dream that we must keep alive for future generations.
https://t.co/18KjxLSAaq I will be joining @CHIRLA and @CAPimmigration for an Instagram Live today to discuss the urgent need for a pathway to citizenship for essential workers. 

It will be live on my IG page at 6:45pm ET. Hope you'll tune in: https://t.co/xuLCBri2Tx https://t.co/wEC4HSk1MC @SenatorLujan Thank you, friend.

Glad to be working alongside you to defend our democracy against dark money and voter suppression! @SenJackyRosen Thank you, @SenJackyRosen.

I will be introducing fellow Californian and @USDOL Deputy Secretary nominee Julie Su in this morning's @HELPCmteDems hearing. Tune in here: https://t.co/bH30dX7PxW It was an honor to deliver my maiden speech on the Senate floor today, made all the more special by having Angela and the boys by my side for it. And of course I had some help from Diego to put the final touches on the speech. https://t.co/JjhOj3oGE1 I just voted to confirm @DebHaalandNM as our next Interior Secretary. Deb is the leader we need to advocate for tribes, champion environmental justice, and tackle the climate crisis. This is a historic day for our country. We can‚Äôt let anything keep us from bold action and progress, including outdated rules or traditions. Too much is on the line.
 
We must end the filibuster. The American Rescue Plan provides a lifeline for families, workers, and small businesses to survive this crisis. But our work is far from over.
 
Now is the time to lead an American comeback that leaves no working family behind. We cannot in good conscience praise immigrant essential workers in one breath while denying them essential human dignity with the next. They have earned the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The reality is that there are two Californias, just as there are two Americas‚Äîone where the stock market reaches new highs for some, and one where others have to decide between buying food or paying their utility bills. We must open our eyes to these systemic inequities. In just one generation, my family went from being immigrant cooks and house cleaners to serving in the U.S. Senate. That is the American Dream I believe in, and one I will work to keep alive for future generations. I‚Äôm honored and humbled to be delivering my maiden speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate today. Watch live here: https://t.co/h02FJY16eV From COVID relief to immigration reform‚Äîthe work we're doing in the Senate is personal to me.

I'm joining @maziehirono &amp; @RepGraceMeng in introducing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to expedite the review of hate crimes, improve reporting, &amp; combat the spread of racist rhetoric. The American Rescue Plan will do more in the fight against child poverty than any legislation in modern history. In California alone, it means we have an opportunity to lift over 550,000 children out of poverty. That is a big deal."

We can‚Äôt keep writing a blank check, and it‚Äôs past time that this two-decade conflict be brought to a responsible end. I look forward to reviewing President Biden‚Äôs plan on troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and working with his Administration. The War in Afghanistan has cost taxpayers trillions of dollars, the lives of 2,300 Americans, more than a thousand coalition troops ‚Äì and many more Afghans. The effects on veterans and military families are immeasurable. I stand with Asian American communities in Michigan and across the United States against discrimination, hate, and violence of any kind. We need to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to show that this kind of bigotry has no place in our society. #StopAsianHate Pregnancy and childbirth should be safe for all but black mothers die from complications at a higher rate than other races.

I‚Äôm confident he will uphold the rule of law @TheJusticeDept, protect civil rights, ensure equal justice under the law for ALL Americans &amp; reform our criminal justice system so it works for everyone. BREAKING: The American Rescue Plan is headed to the President‚Äôs desk. This landmark legislation will provide:

üíµ Stimulus checks for Michiganders
üíâ Resources to accelerate vaccine distribution
üè´ üéí Funding to help schools safely reopen
üíº Support for small businesses As we mark 1 year since the first confirmed #COVID19 cases in MI, we remember all the Michiganders who tragically lost their lives to this pandemic &amp; my heart goes out to their loved ones. While there is light at the end of the tunnel, we must remain vigilant against this virus. The American Rescue Plan includes $1,400 stimulus checks, on top of $600 that was passed in December. 
 
This will make a difference for many Michiganders to help pay their bills, put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. https://t.co/o7kbnYoWKv The American Rescue Plan will extend much-needed assistance to Michiganders out of work because of this pandemic through no fault of their own.

I‚Äôm looking forward to the House passing this bill &amp; @POTUS signing it into law soon. https://t.co/rJCxTpLNue Throughout this pandemic, too many parents &amp; educators have struggled to assist students while juggling other demands.
 
That is why the American Rescue Plan includes $130 billion to help schools reopen safely following public health guidance. While there is light at the end of the tunnel, we need to keep working to make sure we get vaccines in the arms of as many Michiganders as possible.
 
The American Rescue Plan that passed the Senate will help ensure vaccines are distributed safely, more effectively and quicker. https://t.co/0xrekFbGvM On #InternationalWomensDay, I'm reminded of how grateful I am to have amazing women in my life who inspire me each &amp; every day including my mother Madeleine, my wife Colleen, my mother-in-law Kathleen &amp; my two daughters Maddy &amp; Alana. They're my inspiration to fight for equality. https://t.co/vn5Qg5SL8Y As we mark 56 years since #BloodySunday, I‚Äôm pleased President Biden is taking action to promote access to the ballot box. Voting is central to our democracy and his actions will increase access to voter registration services &amp; voting information from the federal government. https://t.co/M0AvbxBq3w As we remember the bravery of those who marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, we pay tribute to the late John Lewis.This is the first Bloody Sunday without Rep. John Lewis. We can carry on his legacy by continuing to march‚Äîfor voting rights, civil rights &amp; a more just society. Farmington Hills‚Äô veteran Robert Simanek is an American hero. We‚Äôre forever grateful for his service and sacrifice to our country. 

This an incredible honor. https://t.co/wwrw2THsof I‚Äôm saddened by the loss of Frank Kelley. He was a legend‚Äînot only for his longevity as Michigan‚Äôs longest-serving attorney general but for his commitment to consumer protections &amp; justice for the people of Michigan. Colleen and I send our deepest condolences to his family. https://t.co/BaTq3yzrXs The American Rescue Plan has PASSED!
¬†
I was proud to help pass this critical legislation to help bring much-needed relief to Michiganders by securing:
¬†
‚úÖ $1,400 stimulus checks
‚úÖFunding to help schools safely reopen
‚úÖFunding to ramp up vaccine distribution We have been working all night and are getting closer to passing the American Rescue Plan. We won‚Äôt stop until we pass the relief Michiganders and Americans need. I was honored to take part in the promotion ceremony tonight for @minationalguard Lieutenant Colonel Samuel LaBara from Richland.
¬†
I‚Äôm proud of the dedication of LTC LaBara and all the Michigan National Guardsmen who selflessly serve the people of Michigan and our country. https://t.co/LHylU1ARlq Proud to work with @SenatorHassan to help secure these vital funds for firefighters &amp; emergency responders to have the resources they need to continue working on the front lines of our communities during this pandemic. https://t.co/NxzSVgaPdR It was an honor to again thank the @MINationalGuard for their service in protecting the Capitol.
 
I remain outraged our Guardsmen were being fed food that was inadequate. I'll keep pressing to ensure they have access to safe and adequate food ‚Äî they have earned nothing less. https://t.co/0gRIHALRYM This isn‚Äôt the time for political games. This is about delivering COVID relief for Michiganders and the American people.

Let‚Äôs pass the American Rescue Plan now ‚Äî without delay. https://t.co/oDSpxOIguN I'm pleased the House has passed the #ForThePeople Act. 

As a co-sponsor of #S1, we must pass this bill in the Senate to strengthen our democracy by: 

üí∞Getting big money out of our politics 
üó≥Ô∏èStrengthening &amp; expand voting rights 
üèõÔ∏èEnsuring public officials work #ForThePeople This is great news! Michiganders need access to affordable health care now more than ever.
 
Visit https://t.co/CFBJ4XT2hi for more information on how to #GetCovered! https://t.co/a9O0TCCqfx The American Rescue Plan would provide robust relief to help families, workers who are out of a job, small businesses struggling to make ends meet &amp; boost vaccine distribution.
 
We can't afford to wait‚ÄîMichiganders need COVID relief now! https://t.co/uvaHfVjYGJ Headed to the Senate floor to speak about the importance of passing the American Rescue Plan. Michiganders are struggling and need assistance ASAP. 

Make sure you tune back in here to watch live. üì∫ https://t.co/NKgpgQ3GBe It‚Äôs always great seeing my friend @SenatorHassan. 
 
Don‚Äôt forget to #MaskUpMichigan https://t.co/UTHu88eqjq The American Rescue Plan provides funding to:

‚úÖAccelerate vaccine distribution
‚úÖActivate mobile vaccination units to reach remote areas
‚úÖEnsure every American will have access to a vaccine
 
The Senate must pass this critical legislation so Michiganders can get vaccines ASAP. 3 hours &amp; 19 minutes.

That‚Äôs how long it took for the National Guard to arrive at the Capitol after help was requested, all while the brave men &amp; women of the Capitol Police risked their lives to protect the symbol of our democracy.

I pressed military officials on this delay. https://t.co/Ix9Bi9lXok I have continued to raise the alarm that our national security agencies have not sufficiently pivoted to meet the threat of domestic terrorism‚Äîincluding white supremacist &amp; anti-government groups. These efforts need to be expanded so a breakdown like Jan. 6  never happens again. https://t.co/LZ1EiyiwDJ There were plenty of indications that January 6th could turn violent. So why were there so many intelligence failures leading up to the attack?
 
As Chairman of @HSGAC, I‚Äôm seeking answers on what exactly happened‚Äîso this never happens again. https://t.co/JVG54y8jH4 I'm pressing for answers so the American people know that without a doubt what happened on January 6th will never happen again. As @HSGAC Chairman, I‚Äôll be leading the second hearing into the security &amp; intelligence failures that led to the Capitol attack.
 
Watch here ‚û°Ô∏è @HSGAC. https://t.co/3LZDyasdlh As @HSGAC Chairman, I'm continuing to press for answers on the failures that led to the horrifying attack on Jan 6‚Äîincluding why it took hours for the National Guard to arrive at the Capitol after the building had been breached.
 
Watch live at 10 AM ‚û°Ô∏è @HSGAC. Credit unions have done incredible work supporting people most in need throughout the pandemic. It was great to virtually meet w/ @MICreditUnions who have continued to provide critical financial relief for Michigan families and small businesses during this very difficult time. https://t.co/Sc3TJt29ct Congratulations to the 35 young women from Michigan who‚Äîalong with others across the country‚Äîmade history by earning their place in the inaugural class of female Eagle Scouts. As an Eagle Scout myself, I could not be more proud. https://t.co/lqTAjzUKmr The lack of progress made by the @DeptofDefense to clean up sites in Michigan impacted by PFAS needs to be addressed‚Äîthis is a public health crisis.
 
I pressed @USGAO on what is being done to clean up these sites &amp; ensure our communities can have access to safe drinking water. https://t.co/Wohu5t3Wlu My colleagues &amp; I secured federal #COVID19 resources so hardworking families can make it through this public health &amp; economic crisis. It‚Äôs past time the state legislature stop withholding these critical resources so Michiganders can get the help they need.https://t.co/5rkJ1Kg8ZA I voted to confirm @GovRaimondo as Commerce Secretary &amp; I‚Äôm glad she was confirmed w/ bipartisan support. Look forward to working together on:

We must pass the American Rescue Plan &amp; do everything we can to reduce child poverty and support working families.
 
What do you think @SenatorBaldwin &amp; @SenDuckworth? Can we count on your support? https://t.co/vknz3MgEcF Proud of the Michiganders who are doing their part to help produce this new #COVID19 vaccine to communities across the country.

Thank you to everyone in Grand Rapids for their incredible work. https://t.co/M9eUaqvbNy The men and women of @MINationalGuard are in DC protecting the Capitol: the very symbol of our democracy.
¬†
This is completely outrageous and unacceptable. It must be fixed‚Äîimmediately‚Äîand I‚Äôll be looking into this as a member of @SASCDems. https://t.co/pljwfAh0Zq The American Rescue Plan includes $1,400 stimulus checks, on top of $600 that was passed in December.
 
This is a lifeline for Michiganders to help pay their bills, put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. 
 
Let‚Äôs pass this bill ASAP. I want to celebrate the remarkable contributions women have made in Michigan &amp; across our country on this first day of #WomensHistoryMonth. Many glass ceilings have been shattered but there‚Äôs more work to do. I‚Äôll keep fighting for equal rights and opportunity for all women. Forward-thinking investments in our students is critical to our state retaining a skilled, diverse workforce.

Pleased that @michiganstateu &amp; @Apple‚Äôs landmark partnership in Detroit will help entrepreneurs from all walks of life &amp; keep Michigan at the forefront of innovation. https://t.co/nDV2JxevMz Michiganders need urgent relief to emerge from this public health &amp; economic crisis.

By passing the American Rescue Plan through the Senate, we can:

üßë‚Äçüè´Give schools resources to safely re-open
üíµSend stimulus checks to struggling families
üíâRamp up vaccinations distribution Investments in programs like the Alpena Community College Manufacturing Skills Center are critical to strengthening skills training opportunities for workers.
 
Proud to help secure this grant &amp; to continue working to keep Michigan manufacturing at the forefront of innovation. https://t.co/aHIjDVpoIo If you haven‚Äôt walked along Detroit‚Äôs Riverwalk, you‚Äôre missing out. Thrilled to see the Detroit International Riverwalk receive this special recognition! https://t.co/vFnAYH0BYs Pleased to see the FDA authorize another #COVID19 vaccine.

This reinforces the need to pass the American Rescue Plan so we can rapidly expand vaccine distribution &amp; improve local coordination to get the vaccines in as many arms as possible. https://t.co/5uezSp7BL1 I pressed @DeptofDefense officials this week on what is being done to increase transparency and improve the federal government‚Äôs coordination with states regarding #COVID19 vaccines.
 
This will help ensure vaccines are distributed safely, effectively and quickly. https://t.co/hs8KIA7YZN Read my full statement on the House passage of the American Rescue Plan and why the Senate must act quickly so we can provide Michiganders with stimulus payments, ramp up vaccinations, and make sure schools can safely reopen. https://t.co/FGfzxnjOTW As we close in on the one-year anniversary of this pandemic, it‚Äôs clear Michiganders need urgent relief.
 
I‚Äôm pleased the House has passed the American Rescue Plan and I will work with my Senate colleagues to swiftly pass this package and get it enacted into law. The Great Lakes are one of Michigan‚Äôs most treasured resources. I‚Äôll keep fighting to secure increased funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative which is critical in fighting against the spread of Asian Carp &amp; other invasive species. #InvSpWk Detroit‚Äôs first African American school teacher, Fannie Richards, was not only a world-educated scholar but fought to desegregate Detroit‚Äôs schools in the 1800s. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/9I1vzlNobC In Michigan, thousands of jobs in outdoor recreation and tourism revolve around strong, healthy, and sustainable ecosystems. That's why I will continue fighting to protect the Endangered Species Act and in turn, our state‚Äôs vital wildlife population. #EndangeredSpeciesWeek I am pleased that @UMichFootball &amp; @NUFBFamily have found such a wonderful way to honor Dr. Jewett‚Äôs proud legacy.

Happy Purim to all who are celebrating! I know this marks roughly a year since the onset of the pandemic and that festivities look different. I‚Äôm hopeful, though, that by this time next year we can all be together. Great conversation with @JCRC_AJC and appreciated the opportunity to provide an update on my priorities in the Senate, passing needed COVID relief &amp; working as @HSGAC Chair to address security threats, including domestic terrorism at houses of worship. Ran into @MINationalGuard members from the UP on my way to vote today! Thank you to them‚Äîand all our Guardsmen‚Äîwho are in DC protecting the Capitol. https://t.co/Wfiahi57wA The House of Representatives has PASSED the #EqualityAct and now it‚Äôs time for the Senate to act.

I'm a proud to co-sponsor of the #EqualityAct. No one in Michigan or across the United States should face discrimination for who they are or who they love. .@JenGranholm has a track record of strong leadership. It is clear she recognizes what must be done to advance our nation‚Äôs energy interests, because she already achieved results in Michigan as Governor.

We‚Äôre all in this together and must keep doing our part to stop the spread of this virus and keep each other safe. This intimidation &amp; symbol of white supremacy has no place in our society: not in Grosse Pointe Park, not in Michigan‚Äînot anywhere. 
 
We must address the very disturbing rise in white supremacy &amp; violence. That‚Äôs one of my priorities as @HSGAC Chairman. https://t.co/IHNfg81CPn This is a great step by @POTUS to provide much-needed relief to small businesses in Michigan &amp; across the US.

"Portman, Rob",senrobportman,robportman,Ohio,Ohio,Senator," As co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, I‚Äôve worked in a bipartisan manner to counter the continued aggression of #Russia against #Ukraine. These sanctions help to show that the US continues to stand w #Ukraine to secure a democratic, prosperous &amp; independent future. I‚Äôm glad to see the Biden admin finally address #Russia‚Äôs continued occupation of the Crimean Peninsula through today‚Äôs sanctions. It is vital that we continue to support our allies in #Ukraine. https://t.co/9iv23zJ7He These sanctions &amp; Russian attribution for the #SolarWinds hack follows the bipartisan letter I sent the admin last week calling for real-world consequences for cyberattacks against the US. https://t.co/BlH7CT1fIw I‚Äôm pleased the Biden admin has announced sanctions &amp; other actions against #Russia for its malign activities, including occupation of the Crimean Peninsula, cyberattacks &amp; attempts to influence the 2020 US presidential election. https://t.co/9iv23zrwiE Today I called on @POTUS &amp; his admin to address the backlog of 480k requests for military service records from the Natl Personnel Records Center. 

Ready access to their military records is an obligation we owe to veterans &amp; their families. A backlog of this size is unacceptable. These figures paint a clear picture: the #COVID19 pandemic has exacerbated the addiction epidemic, leading to a record surge in overdose deaths. 

CARA 3.0 will help turn the tide of this scourge by providing additional resources &amp; expanding treatment options. Happy Independence Day to our friends in #Israel! 

May the special relationship between our two great nations continue to grow and prosper. Yom ha‚Äôatzmaut sameach! In my op-ed for @RealClearNews, I discuss 4 proposals that would reduce the current pull factors that have created the current crisis at our southern border. 

If @POTUS doesn‚Äôt take immediate action, this crisis will only grow worse. https://t.co/PupmHRp2gm 87,000 Americans lost their lives to drug overdoses in just 12 months.

In 22 days, fentanyl analogues - which are responsible for many of these deaths - will effectively become legal &amp; unregulated. 

We can‚Äôt allow that to happen. These lethal drugs must be permanently banned. The heartbreaking surge in overdose deaths underscores the need for gov't officials &amp; community leaders to redouble our efforts to combat addiction &amp; drug abuse. 

Let‚Äôs start by passing CARA 3.0 - sweeping bipartisan legislation to turn the tide of this crisis &amp; help save lives. https://t.co/PpxPpV1Thm This is so heartbreaking. 87,000 overdose deaths in one year. Honestly tough to fully comprehend these tragic figures. 

One thing is for sure: The addiction crisis is raging in America. We must take decisive action to address it.  https://t.co/sMMPYeuQBI That‚Äôs why I asked the witnesses at today‚Äôs #HSGAC hearing how to best address the problems @CDCgov faced at the beginning of the #COVID19 pandemic w/ surveillance systems &amp; inaccurate tests. Last year, @CDCgov‚Äôs defective tests resulted in a lack of in-state #COVID19 testing in #Ohio from Feb 7 until March 5. That can't happen again. https://t.co/lfEt31USuC Prior to 9/11, al Qaeda used Afghanistan as a safe haven to plan, train, and execute attacks on the U.S. and our allies around the world.

This will undermine our competitiveness, stifle economic growth and hurt families and workers. #jobs
 
Graphic via @TaxFoundation https://t.co/RukXqbmjcs Mahoning Valley lost a giant this week with the passing of Clarence ‚ÄúSonny‚Äù Smith. 

He enriched the lives of all of us who knew him with his warmth and hospitality, and his contributions to so many civic causes made the Valley a better place to live and work. https://t.co/pIgaZY4Q5V There is a far better way for us to go about this. Let‚Äôs pursue a bipartisan approach focused on what we have all agreed is infrastructure ‚Äì roads, bridges, ports, rail, broadband, other true infrastructure. Even with the added infrastructure, the Penn-Wharton Model projects that @POTUS‚Äôs tax plan would result in about a 1% reduction in GDP and a 0.7% drop in wages by 2031 over current projections.https://t.co/pVert7GFbN CBO has estimated that 70% of corporate tax increases are paid by workers. Why would we want to put in place policies that lead to less U.S. investment &amp; fewer jobs at a time when the global economy is more competitive than ever before? The largest US companies increased domestic R&amp;D spending by 25% ($707B) and capital expenditures by 20% ($1.438 trillion). All of this led to job creation, wage growth and economic prosperity. The unemployment rate plummeted to 3.5% and we saw the lowest poverty rate on record. In 2017, we lowered business tax rates to level the playing field and make the United States competitive once again. The results were incredible. $1.6T in overseas earnings came back home to invest &amp; create #jobs here. Under the Biden tax plan, US businesses would pay a combined tax rate of 32.8% - that is by far the highest rate in the developed world. This would hurt our economy, send businesses overseas and stifle investment in our cities and communities. To help pay for his ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù plan, @POTUS is proposing one of the biggest tax hikes in American history, totaling roughly $2.1 trillion. These tax increases will lower wages, undermine economic growth, make America less competitive &amp; hurt our economy. Moreover, just $115 billion goes towards our nation‚Äôs roads and bridges. That‚Äôs less than 5%. It spends more on nursing homes ($400 billion) and schools and daycare ($137 billion) than it does on roads and bridges. The Biden plan costs about $2.7 trillion, but only about $600 billion is directed toward traditional infrastructure like roads, bridges, transit, rail, and ports. That‚Äôs just 20% of the overall plan. President Biden‚Äôs massive $2.7 trillion ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù plan is filled with broad policy priorities that are a far cry from what has ever been defined as infrastructure, by either Democrats or Republicans. I have long believed in and advocated for investing more in our nation‚Äôs infrastructure, including modernizing our roads, bridges, transit, ports and more. But we should focus on our core infrastructure needs to help grow our economy. ‚ÄúGreater love has no one than this: to lay down one‚Äôs life for one‚Äôs friends.‚Äù

Today we honor the life of @CapitolPolice Ofc. William Evans, who was killed in the line of duty a few wks ago. My prayers &amp; deepest condolences are with Ofc.

More in my op-ed for @RealClearNews: https://t.co/PupmHRp2gm For more than 20yrs, the New Markets Tax Credit program has benefited #Ohio by fueling private investment into communities in need, creating jobs and promoting economic development. 
 
We should make this successful, bipartisan program permanent.  https://t.co/sliWtYVRHb Now is the time for @NATO to provide Ukraine a pathway to full membership. 

#Ukraine has been granted Enhanced Opportunity Partner status and has proved to be a worthy and capable ally who is seeking to align with the democratic west. President Biden‚Äôs massive tax increases will make U.S. businesses less competitive, hurt American workers and undermine job creation in America. 
 
This is the last thing we need at a time when our economy is just starting to recover. https://t.co/RrIQ2iPfWW Pres. Biden's $2.7 trillion plan goes way beyond any reasonable definition of infrastructure and is mostly paid for with a devastating tax hike that'll hurt US workers &amp; families. 
 
This is the wrong approach. https://t.co/E7Ki5yDZOi Fentanyl analogues are among the deadliest drugs on the planet. 

In 24 days they will effectively become legal and unregulated. 

I'm glad @POTUS supports a short-term extension, but we need a permanent fix. https://t.co/ycjLX3gxxi Today, @FEMA will begin accepting applications for #COVID19 Funeral Assistance. 

More info on how you can apply &amp; avoid scammers can be found here: https://t.co/aiZ3iTElIr Great read from the @WSJ‚Äôs editorial board on the ongoing crisis at the southern border. 

I agree that this humanitarian crisis will only get worse unless the Biden admin changes course &amp; addresses this crisis. https://t.co/C7LRauPEgt I remain concerned about the continued massing of Russian forces on the eastern border of #Ukraine and #Crimea. 

The Administration and #NATO must support #Ukraine and tell Russia to de-escalate the situation. By making skills training programs more accessible &amp; affordable, the JOBS Act will provide opportunities to tens of thousands of Americans &amp; help our economy fill the critical jobs needed to recover from this pandemic. Appreciate @GovMikeDeWine's support for this critical effort. https://t.co/ugh8MhycbO This situation is not only unsustainable, it‚Äôs dangerous. @POTUS must put policies in place to discourage unlawful immigration that adheres to our common American values of humanity, decency, and the rule of law. The border crisis is a direct result of @POTUS‚Äôs decision to dismantle the previous admin‚Äôs immigration policies with no consideration of the ramifications of removing those policies and how it would incentivize migration. https://t.co/7KzJmCYeuu One of the tragic consequences of the #COVID19 pandemic has been a surge in drug addiction &amp; overdoses. 

CARA 3.0 will help turn the tide of this crisis by providing needed resources and enacting policies to expand treatment options. https://t.co/XJqPuXL4tO I urge @POTUS and @VPOTUS to prioritize a trip to the southern border so they can see that the current policies their administration has put in place are not working. We need action now to protect these kids. Anyone who has seen the current crisis at the border firsthand knows that we need immediate action in order to protect these unaccompanied children who are in immediate danger of trafficking and abuse. In 26 days, the federal ban on fentanyl analogues will expire, which will open the door for traffickers in China and Mexico to flood our communities with these deadly substances. 

We can‚Äôt allow this to happen. https://t.co/uUmfR9dtEf This week, @SenGaryPeters &amp; I sent letters to @DHSgov &amp; @OMBpress urging them to send us all the info they have on the #SolarWinds cyberattack. 

We still don‚Äôt know the full extent of the damage. More from @AP: https://t.co/ruvj18TF1y In less than a month the federal ban on fentanyl analogues - which are some of the deadliest drugs on the planet - will expire. 

We can‚Äôt allow that to happen. The FIGHT Fentanyl Act will permanently criminalize these poisonous substances. Traffickers are taking advantage of the crisis and smuggling in both humans and deadly drugs. Seizures of fentanyl have more than tripled in 2021 compared to 2020. We have to act now. https://t.co/7KzJmCYeuu Last month, on my trip to the southern border, I heard directly from Border Patrol agents about how the current surge of unlawful migrants is straining resources, endangering not just the vulnerable unaccompanied children, but the security of our own border. REMINDER: On Monday, @FEMA will begin accepting applications for #COVID19 Funeral Assistance. 

More information on how you can apply and avoid scammers can be found here: https://t.co/aiZ3iTElIr The federal govt should not repeat the mistakes of prior administrations &amp; hand these vulnerable children off to traffickers or other abusive situations. There must be accountability to ensure the govt can keep track of the kids as they make their way through the legal system. I am deeply troubled by the media reports this week of sexual abuse of unaccompanied children at holding facilities along the southern border. No child should ever be subjected to this kind of treatment &amp; @POTUS must take immediate action. https://t.co/7KzJmCYeuu It is past time for @POTUS to implement critical policy changes in order to stop the flow of unlawful border crossings and give our overwhelmed Border Patrol agents the resources &amp; support they need. https://t.co/PupmHRp2gm In my op-ed for @RealClearNews, I highlighted the ongoing crisis at the southern border as @CBP has reported 172,000 total encounters at the border in March, a 70% increase since Feb. https://t.co/PupmHRp2gm Last year‚Äôs #SolarWinds cyberattack on our federal govt should serve as a wakeup call. 

As this @AP article highlights, we need to know the full extent of the damage done by the hack &amp; some federal agencies are withholding that information from Congress. https://t.co/ruvj18TF1y One of the few bright spots of this pandemic has been the rapid adoption of telemedicine. Expanded telehealth services have helped bolster access to¬†addiction¬†treatment. 

We should make these telehealth services permanent moving forward.
https://t.co/WPqHGjDD5I This situation is unsustainable. I continue to urge @POTUS to put policies in place to discourage unlawful immigration that adheres to our common American values of humanity, decency, and the rule of law. The Biden admin‚Äôs border crisis of unlawful migrants being detained at overcrowded Border Patrol stations is a direct result of its decision to dismantle the previous admin‚Äôs policies w no consideration of how removing those policies would incentivize migration. While at the southern border, I heard directly from Border Patrol agents about how the current surge of unlawful migrants is straining resources, endangering not just the vulnerable unaccompanied children, but the security of our own border https://t.co/7KzJmCYeuu I‚Äôm deeply troubled by the media reports that @POTUS is removing critical protections for unaccompanied kids in an effort to expedite processing &amp; place them w sponsors, as well as reports of sexual abuse of these vulnerable children at holding facilities. https://t.co/7KzJmCYeuu I'm concerned by @CBP‚Äôs new data showing 172,000+ total encounters at the border in March, up 70% from Feb &amp; more than 5 times the March 2020 numbers. 

This includes 53,000+ migrant family members, nearly 100,000 single adult migrants &amp; nearly 19,000 unaccompanied children. My team and I are closely monitoring the situation at the paint factory in Columbus. 

Many thanks to the first responders who rushed to the scene last night. My prayers are with everyone involved. https://t.co/7rPd1QCgY8 Today on Yom HaShoah - #HolocaustRemembranceDay - we remember the 6 million Jewish men, women and children who were brutally murdered by the Nazi regime. 

Together, let us reaffirm our commitment to fighting anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms. #NeverAgain https://t.co/KHewMqOcAI As the Ranking Member of #HSGAC, I‚Äôll continue to work w my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep these vulnerable children safe. In March I sent a bipartisan letter to DHS &amp; HHS highlighting recommendations for best practices generated by these oversight investigations. These are not being followed. Since 2015, I have issued 3 reports &amp; held 3 hearings to highlight our bipartisan findings about DHS and HHS failures to appropriately care for these children. I am deeply troubled by media reports of sexual abuse at facilities holding unaccompanied children. I urge @POTUS to take action immediately to keep these vulnerable children safe. https://t.co/xW0zuN5TLz Deeply saddened to learn of Selinde Roosenburg's passing. 

Jane and I our keeping her family, friends and ODNR colleagues in our thoughts and prayers.https://t.co/gCwljHMerV On this #WorldHealthDay, I hope you will join me celebrating the doctors, nurses, paramedics, and other health care professionals who have been on the front lines of this pandemic since day 1. I‚Äôm continuously inspired by their dedication, bravery &amp; tireless work ethic. If you are an Ohio student interested in seeking a nomination to one of the four US military academics, please check out this link for more information. 

The application is now live and virtual informational seminars are scheduled for the coming weeks. Officer Evans was a hero who lost his life in defense of our Capitol and our democracy. 

Our prayers are with his family, friends, and fellow officers. May he Rest In Peace. https://t.co/uDBWuKYbuL Appreciate the widespread support for the #RECYCLEAct. 

This bipartisan bill will improve our recycling systems through better education and public awareness. Recycling helps keep our communities clean and supports 681,000+ recycling #jobs. The #COVID19 pandemic has exacerbated the addiction epidemic, leading to a record surge in overdose deaths. 

This underscores the need for Congress to pass CARA 3.0 - sweeping, bipartisan legislation to combat addiction &amp; expand treatment. https://t.co/Co2v8Au8ar Great to see Hamilton Caster planning for the future with a beautiful new facility I visited today. 

One of their big challenges right now is finding skilled workers to fill jobs - machinists in particular. The #JOBSAct is focused on closing this exact skills gap. https://t.co/m0ihpenIam In 30 days, the federal ban on fentanyl analogues will expire. 

These are some of the deadliest drugs in the world &amp; have killed countless Americans. 

We need to permanently criminalize these poisonous substances once and for all. https://t.co/88ER87JrcM At the outset of #COVID pandemic, Hamilton Caster participated in the Paycheck Protection Program that I strongly supported. Thanks to the PPP, they did not have to lay off anyone. Workers I talked to appreciated the way the company handled the economic downturn. Enjoyed visiting Hamilton Caster today. Since I was last there 7 years ago, the company has continued to grow. 

It is a great example of a successful family-owned #Ohio manufacturing company that takes pride in producing high-quality products and looking out for its workforce. https://t.co/FiLXophtyM The massive tax increases proposed by the Biden Admin &amp; Senate Dems will undermine America‚Äôs competitiveness on the world stage and hurt our economy. #Jobs https://t.co/nRIS1whMpl President Biden‚Äôs tax hikes will result in fewer jobs and lower wages. 

This is a bad plan for the American people... Especially as folks are struggling to get back on their feet after a global pandemic. https://t.co/hDLkW9LXw0 In response to our recent hearing, @SenGaryPeters &amp; I sent letters to @DHSgov &amp; @OMBPress requesting info on how they plan to fortify our federal cyber defenses to ensure we can deter, detect, and address attacks like #SolarWinds Orion in the future. https://t.co/BlH7CT1fIw As our recent #HSGAC hearing demonstrated, there‚Äôs no easy solution to advanced persistent cyber threats like the #SolarWinds hack. It‚Äôs important that we deter foreign adversaries by creating real-world consequences for cyberattacks against the US. The massive tax increases proposed by the Biden administration &amp; Senate Dems will make US businesses less competitive, undermine investment in America &amp; destroy jobs for American workers and families. 

This is the wrong approach and I strongly oppose it. The Biden administration‚Äôs public statements have done nothing to stop unlawful immigrants &amp; deadly narcotics at our border, as evidenced by this massive increase in the last month. We must end this surge &amp; reduce the magnet that pulls migrants to the US. The crisis at our southern border continues to get worse and hit a 15 year high in March, with the number of unlawful immigrants encountered at the border skyrocketing to 170,000 last month and more than quadrupling from March 2020. More from @WSJ: https://t.co/ZXYjluO0nU This should not be a partisan issue. There are many areas Congress and the administration can work together on to ease this influx and reduce the pull of the magnet that brings these migrants to our border. The humanitarian crisis unfolding on our southern border is not only affecting thousands of children and their families, but it also poses serious national security risks &amp; we‚Äôre seeing a major influx of deadly drugs into our communities. Encouraged @Potus called #Ukraine Pres Zelensky to reaffirm commitment to support #Ukraine. Administration and Congress must be united in condemning Russian aggression and send message we stand with #Ukraine. One of the most dangerous aspects of the #SolarWinds cyberattack is that we still don‚Äôt know the extent of the damage done. 

This hack was a victory for our foreign adversaries &amp; a failure for our fed agencies. More from @AP: https://t.co/HVWTealKLc There are millions of job openings for skilled occupations like welders &amp; machinists, but not enough people to fill them.

The #JOBSAct will address this problem by making skills training programs more accessible and affordable. President Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù package only invests about 5% of his massive $2.3 trillion proposal on modernizing roads, bridges and highways. 

Good @WSJ piece that explains more: https://t.co/mBtedcoelf Great news! Wishing officer Shaver a full and speedy recovery. https://t.co/51VTu4KUZo Jane &amp; I want to wish everyone a very happy Easter. On Easter, we are reminded that even during the darkest of times, hope remains. Let us draw on that hope as we renew our bonds of faith &amp; family. As the @AP recently highlighted, we held a hearing in #HSGAC on the need for greater accountability, transparency &amp; increased cybersecurity measures in our fed govt. The #SolarWinds hack was dangerous and a wake-up call on much-needed cybersecurity reform. https://t.co/ki5kEFt9kJ As Ranking Member of #HSGAC, I‚Äôm working with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to provide federal agencies with the most up-to-date cyber defenses to deter, detect, and address future cyberattacks, like last year‚Äôs #SolarWinds hack. The surge in overdose deaths in Ohio this past year is heartbreaking. It underscores the need for us to take aggressive action to combat the addiction crisis. 

On demand side, let‚Äôs pass CARA 3.0 - sweeping, bipartisan legislation to combat addiction &amp; expand treatment options. E-Verify will require all employers to use the system which will reduce the job magnet that remains the biggest draw for unlawful workers. I totally understand wanting to make a better life for your family, but it‚Äôs important to do it the right way &amp; enter the U.S. lawfully. One way I believe we can reduce the pull of unlawful migrants coming to our border is to make my bipartisan E-Verify Act law. The goal of E-Verify is to provide a simple, reliable way for employers to confirm a new employee‚Äôs identity &amp; work eligibility. We must put smart policies in place to address the ongoing surge, and provide the Border Patrol the resources and technology to do the job we ask them to do. Our Border Patrol agents told me firsthand that they are already stretched thin, and the new Biden Admin policies only make the situation worse for fentanyl and other illegal drugs and for unlawful entries. According to this @CNN report, the US is on track to encounter more than 2 million unlawful migrants at our southern border by the end of the year, a record high number. https://t.co/wBL1HsZoc3 Good read from the @WSJ ed board on President Biden‚Äôs proposed tax hikes, which may be the biggest tax increases in 50 years. 

This is the last thing we need as working families and businesses struggle to rebound from the COVID crisis.  https://t.co/Wkic2eF93S The men and women of the @CapitolPolice put their lives on the line every day in defense of our Capitol and our democracy. 

I hope you will join me in praying for Officer Evans, his fellow injured officer, and their families. Jane and I are sending our prayers &amp; deepest condolences to Officer Evans‚Äô family, friends, and fellow @CapitolPolice officers. 

May his memory be a blessing. https://t.co/eqX0WliaVd This is heartbreaking. My prayers are with the officer's family, friends, and colleagues on the USCP force. 

God bless the US Capitol Police. https://t.co/KM4169hQQX https://t.co/2IWMPANZwg Closely monitoring the situation at the US Capitol. My prayers are with the two @CapitolPolice officers who were injured in the line of duty. 
 
A reminder of the dangers law enforcement personnel face every day as they put themselves in harm‚Äôs way to keep us safe. https://t.co/TFJDMQC6VY Jane and I wish everyone a blessed #GoodFriday, and a safe and happy Easter weekend. Huge thanks to the @Reds for inviting me to throw out the first pitch at #RedsOpeningDay!  

Baseball is finally back! https://t.co/mCX7pJTCRy Deeply concerned about deployment of Russian forces near Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. I have visited the Line of Contact and seen bravery of the Ukrainian forces firsthand. 

Ukrainian sovereignty must be respected. We stand with #Ukraine. Congress needs to pass the bipartisan FIGHT Fentanyl Act to fix this problem by permanently classifying fentanyl analogues as Schedule 1 substances. In 35 days the classification of fentanyl analogues as Schedule 1 substances will expire, allowing criminals in Mexico and China to flood the US with unlimited supply of deadly fentanyl. https://t.co/88ER87JrcM Grateful for the widespread support from leaders across Ohio for the #JOBSAct 
 
This crucial bill will help folks get the tech skills and job training they need to land in-demand jobs and succeed in today‚Äôs economy. Incredible story from @CBP about a Yuma Sector Border Patrol canine who was able to sniff out nearly 5 lbs of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl that was hidden in food by a smuggler. 

Grateful for the awesome work of this agent &amp; his canine partner. https://t.co/FNzMqb3wEy Earlier this year I had a chance to see firsthand the crucial support the @OHNationalGuard is providing to Second Harvest and other food banks across #Ohio. 

We are grateful for their hard work &amp; dedication. https://t.co/Jp4SsPbqiw I support improving America‚Äôs aging roads, bridges, ports, and other infrastructure, but @POTUS' $2T+ infrastructure proposal is filled with unrelated policy priorities &amp; massive tax increases on job creators struggling to rebound from the pandemic. 

This is the wrong approach. Great work by our very own @CincyChildrens, leading the way on testing the safety &amp; efficacy of COVID vaccines in children. They were a partner in today‚Äôs announcement from Pfizer &amp; are continuing to run more trials so we can get all of our kids vaccinated.https://t.co/oKaBef0T8r As #WomensHistoryMonth draws to a close, I hope you‚Äôll join me in honoring the pioneering women whose incredible accomplishments have broken barriers+fundamentally changed our nation 4 the better. May they continue to serve as inspirations for the nxt generation of female leaders https://t.co/xMDPW29kxu The drug and opioid addiction epidemic is devastating communities in every corner of the country. 
 
The fed gov‚Äôt must act now to stem this worsening crisis. 
 
Let's start by passing CARA 3.0 - sweeping, bipartisan legislation to combat addiction &amp; expand treatment options. I commend our international partners for joining U.S. in expressing concern over WHO study in China re: origins of COVID-19. 

China needs to be transparent with the world about the origins of the virus that has killed more than 2.5M people. https://t.co/xmtQoFXNo8 Happy #NationalDoctorsDay to all the doctors who have been on the frontlines of this pandemic since day one.

Your courage, dedication, and selflessness is an inspiration to us all. Harriet Tubman dedicated her life to helping others escape the bondage of slavery. She was a trailblazer who paved the way for countless civil &amp; womens rights leaders.

Proud to support legislation honoring Tubman's life+legacy by creating commemorative coins. #WomensHistoryMonth As Jon Graft notes in this Cincinnati @Enquirer letter, we are currently facing a serious shortage of skilled workers. 

The #JOBSAct will alleviate this problem by making skills training programs more accessible and affordable. #jobs https://t.co/bnsTYsD3ad Agree with the actions taken by @USTradeRep.

We must not stand idly by as the Burmese security forces kill peaceful protestors and suppress basic human rights.
https://t.co/jkTJJ5wTxl Great news out of Preble County. @RoyalCanin will be investing $390M &amp; adding 200+ jobs for a new factory expansion in Lewisburg.

As the economy continues to reopen, more employers are hiring and my JOBS Act will help Ohio retain the workforce it needs.https://t.co/dpPDfZikvQ Today we honor the brave men and women who served so honorably during the Vietnam War. 

Your service and sacrifice will never be forgotten. #VietnamWarVeteransDay https://t.co/RJDQMTKlBT Rpts indicate that Burmese security forces have killed 100+ civilians in just the past several days. The violence against innocent civilians in Myanmar must stop.

I stand ready to work w the admin to immediately end this violence+restore peace &amp; democracy.https://t.co/g8VpepWckx There are millions of job openings for positions for skilled workers like welders &amp; machinists, but not enough people to fill them. 

The #JOBSAct will address this problem by making skills training programs more accessible and affordable. As Ranking Member of #HSGAC, I am working with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to provide federal agencies with the most up to date cyber defenses to deter, detect, and address attacks like this in the future. The #SolarWinds hack was a victory for our foreign adversaries, and a failure for @DHSgov. This @AP article details not only how damaging this hack was, but the most alarming detail that we still don‚Äôt know the extent of the damage. https://t.co/ki5kEFt9kJ Eye-opening story from @AP on how dangerous the #SolarWinds cyberattack was on our federal agencies. 

Recently, we held a hearing in #HSGAC on the need for greater transparency &amp; increased cybersecurity measures in our fed govt. https://t.co/ki5kEFt9kJ That is why I will soon introduce the bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act to ensure our taxpayer-funded research &amp; IP is protected from China and other foreign actors. As my bipartisan #PSI investigation in 2019 showed, China has been stealing our taxpayer-funded research &amp; technology to fuel their military &amp; economic rise for two decades. It‚Äôs time we put a stop to it. https://t.co/It5ggPrZGj My recommendations to prevent children from being put in danger include immediate asylum adjudications at the border, encouraging people  to apply for asylum in their home countries or in a safe 3rd country, &amp; making the E-Verify employment system mandatory. Earlier this week on @TheLead I highlighted 3 areas where @POTUS could change course on the crisis at our southern border &amp; put in place smart policies that address the need for legal &amp; orderly processes for migration &amp; reduce the pull factors that encourage unlawful migration. https://t.co/mphoV89XLX Eligible organizations across #Ohio should apply for these funds &amp; I look forward to seeing the best practices and capabilities developed through this grant program. Violent extremism &amp; targeted violence have no place in our country. That‚Äôs why I was proud to support $20M in grant funding for the Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program, which will work to prevent terrorism &amp; targeted violence in communities across the US. The admin must change course and put in place new policies that help mitigate the pull that brings these migrants to the U.S., all while supporting our Border Patrol officers who are severely overwhelmed by this ever-increasing surge. On the @scottsands show earlier this week I talked about my recent trip to the southern border and the crisis I saw firsthand. Hundreds of individuals, families, and children crossing every day. https://t.co/U3XoVpZaIv As I said on the @Senatefloor earlier this week, during my trip to El Paso I heard directly from Border Patrol agents who said this surge is straining their resources, endangering not just these unaccompanied kids, but also the security of our border. When the Biden admin dismantled the Trump admin‚Äôs border policies without replacing those policies with new ones to stop unlawful migrations, it gave the green light for tens of thousands to cross our southern border. https://t.co/kBGxO06mZB Jane and I wish the Jewish community in Ohio and around the world a blessed¬†#Passover. Chag Sameach! We should now look to build off the success of the Abraham Accords by encouraging additional Arab League states to normalize relations with Israel. The establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel &amp; UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco is a huge step toward creating a more peaceful &amp; prosperous Middle East. We eliminated earmarks nearly 10 yrs ago but now Dems are bringing them back. We need to do away with them once and for all. 

At a time of record debt, it is more important than ever to cut unnecessary &amp; wasteful spending. https://t.co/EAgtqaaI9A Over the past yr, we‚Äôve seen a heartbreaking surge in overdose deaths throughout Ohio. 

This week I introduced legislation to stem the tide of this crisis. CARA 3.0 will support those who‚Äôve been afflicted by addiction and help save lives. The addiction crisis is raging in America. Over the past year we‚Äôve seen a surge in addiction and overdose deaths. 

CARA 3.0 will provide resources &amp; enact policies to combat this worsening crisis and save lives. Normalization of relations between Israel and other countries in the region will help build on the success of the Abraham Accords, support our ally Israel &amp; enshrine the longstanding U.S. policy that encourages Arab League states to normalize relations with #Israel. CARA 3.0 bolsters evidence-based programs &amp; provides the resources needed to combat addiction &amp; save lives. One of the heartbreaking consequences of this pandemic has been the sharp rise in addiction &amp; drug overdoses. 
 
Today I introduced bipartisan legislation with @SenWhitehouse, @SenCapito, @SenAmyKlobuchar &amp; @SenatorShaheen to address this crisis. Today, and every day, we honor the American service members who earned our nation‚Äôs highest honor. 
 
We are eternally grateful for their heroism, service, and sacrifice. #MedalOfHonorDay https://t.co/cU9TlUbCQ2 The drug &amp; opioid epidemic has ravaged far too many families in #Ohio &amp; across our nation. This is a crisis that requires immediate action.

That's why today I intro'd CARA 3.0 - sweeping bipartisan legislation to turn the tide of this epidemic &amp; help those who've been afflicted. We must reopen schools so no child is left behind &amp; every school that has reopened, no matter when, should receive federal assistance to ensure they have all the safety and personal protective gear they need to operate safely and stay open. Today during the #HSGAC hearing, @FEMA nominee Deanne Criswell committed to working with Congress on a bipartisan basis to change the eligibility for reimbursement of schools that safely reopened prior to 2021 like many in #Ohio https://t.co/rFH9uFcFb5 .@FEMA has been requested to provide disaster assistance to address the surge of migrants but @POTUS has not issued an emergency declaration.

Today, I pressed the @FEMA nominee on how the administration should work to address the migrant surge. https://t.co/JdhhFj0fvI I also highlighted @FEMA‚Äôs role in the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which provides grants to faith-based &amp; other nonprofit orgs to help secure their facilities against potential terrorist attacks. I recently worked to double the amount of funding NSGP receives. This morning I delivered opening remarks at a #HSGAC hearing on the nominee to be @FEMA Administrator. 

This role is incredibly important b/c FEMA not only handles response to natural disaster &amp; emergencies, but also the ongoing #COVID19 pandemic response. https://t.co/hxTOTBUlWW The Biden admin should address this crisis through immediate adjudications for asylum claims at the border, allowing these unaccompanied kids to apply for asylum in safe 3rd countries &amp; making E-Verify mandatory. https://t.co/U3XoVpZaIv Great to be on the @ScottSands show earlier this week to discuss the crisis I saw firsthand at the border last wk &amp; my thoughts on how we can address it. This is a direct result of the Biden admin dismantling the Trump admin‚Äôs policies w/out having smart policies to put in place Why am I against earmarks? 
 
1. Gov‚Äôt spending is already way out of control.
2. Earmarks tend to be doled on the basis of political seniority, not merit.
3. We don‚Äôt need any more Bridges to Nowhere. https://t.co/KmKjtuqs38 Bringing back earmarks makes no sense. 

At a time of record debt, it is more important than ever to eliminate unnecessary &amp; wasteful spending. 

Congress should ban earmarks once and for all. https://t.co/k7YWvQBQ1b Congrats to the Shawnee State men‚Äôs basketball program (@ShawneeStateMBB), the 2021 NAIA National Champions! https://t.co/fL9hx7HT7B Raising taxes on businesses and job creators will directly hurt the middle class. 

This is the last thing we need as families try to get back on their feet after the #COVID19 economic crisis.
https://t.co/S3n17NFad1 I encourage organizations across #Ohio to apply for these funds &amp; I look forward to seeing the best practices and capabilities developed through this grant program. https://t.co/8xYOL9AYys I was pleased to support $20 million for the Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention grant program to develop innovative solutions for preventing and countering terrorism and targeted violence in communities across the country. This afternoon, I pressed the Acting Director of the @uscensusbureau on the ongoing 2020 Census data delay &amp; how that will impact legislative redistricting in #Ohio &amp; across the nation. https://t.co/qBS1YbYneE I called on the Biden admin to change course by allowing immediate adjudications for asylum claims at the border, allowing UACs to apply for asylum in safe third countries &amp; making E-Verify mandatory for all employers. https://t.co/vic11vsBoz On @TheLeadCNN this afternoon, I made it clear that the Biden admin's border crisis is a direct result of its dismantling of Trump admin‚Äôs policies with no consideration of the ramifications &amp; how it would incentivize migration. https://t.co/LCjOR28F0I Thank you to the incredible farmers in Ohio and across the nation who work tirelessly to provide Americans with a safe, healthy &amp; abundant food supply. #NationalAgDay https://t.co/ljd0Howkn5 Fifth, we must reduce the magnet for migrants coming to the US by making the E-Verify program mandatory for all businesses and sanction employers who violate the law. Fourth the admin should finish the Congressionally authorized construction on the wall. BP agents told me the old fencing doesnt stop migrants crossing illegally. Construction materials lay abandoned due to admin‚Äôs decision to stop the wall. Let's finish what was already paid for Third, the Biden admin should renew the Migrant Protection Protocols, or Remain in Mexico policy, to stem the tide of migrants released into the US with no court date. Second, we should return to rapid asylum claim adjudications on the border to deter migrants coming for economic reasons and stop false asylum claimants from getting into the country. First, and foremost, the Biden admin should enforce our immigration laws and give overwhelmed Border Patrol agents &amp; our Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials the resources they need to complete their national security mission. The Biden administration has the authority to end the crisis they created at our southern border. 

Last night, I laid out 5 actions he should take to fix this border crisis. https://t.co/gMn6P6vfF2 I heard directly from Border Patrol agents last week who said this surge is overwhelming them. Resources are strained, endangering not just these unaccompanied children, but also the security of our own border. https://t.co/kBGxO0nXR9 Actions speak louder than words &amp; the actions of the Biden admin were clear. Their abrupt moves to dismantle the previous admins immigration policies w/out replacing new ones to discourage unlawful migrations gave the green light for tens of thousands to cross our southern border https://t.co/fzcQe9oQeZ Given its long-running financial struggles the Postal Service is in desperate need of legislative reform. I'll be closely reviewing the plan proposed today &amp; will continue to work on bipartisan postal reform that protects service for #Ohio &amp; the US &amp; puts USPS on a stable footing Jane and I are heartbroken by the tragedy yesterday in Boulder, CO. 

Our deepest sympathies are with the families of the victims. https://t.co/UpHXyWV5h8 Harriet Beecher Stowe is one of America‚Äôs most celebrated abolitionists and civil rights activists.

Her house in Cincinnati, OH‚Äîwhich is currently open to the public as a museum‚Äîserves as a monument to her enduring legacy &amp; transformative impact on society. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/IUaq8Ul6EQ Many thanks to the Ohio State Highway Patrol (@OSHP) for their efforts to keep these lethal drugs off our streets and out of our communities. https://t.co/DYm9ryJotv This is just one of the many reasons why we must work to immediately address the ongoing crisis at the southern border.

As I heard from Border Control last week, these numbers don‚Äôt include everything that slips through into our communities, taking lives in Ohio &amp; across the US. https://t.co/HDQ5zMBv04 Important update: families and businesses will now have until May 17th, 2021 to file their 2020 taxes. https://t.co/nuzw3XSP3k Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. We need to have their backs, as well. And that means prosecuting those criminals who intentionally target police officers to the fullest extent of the law. Attn Ohioans ‚Üí If you are 40 or older, you are now eligible to get your #COVID19 vaccine. 

Visit https://t.co/mWUAa7dQGk to book an appointment near you! I appreciated the opportunity to speak with @SecMayorkas on my trip to the border about the ongoing crisis of migrants and unaccompanied children making the dangerous journey north and what more could be done. https://t.co/cWftTeHN0l Tariffs are an important and effective tool we can use to hold countries accountable for violating our trade laws. 

But we must ensure they are always employed in a way that protects American jobs and strengthens the U.S. economy. https://t.co/5WWp3DqF8b This morning on @FacetheNation, I urged the Biden admin to address the ongoing crisis at the southern border. 

The Border Patrol agents I spoke with this week on my trip to El Paso are overwhelmed and need all the resources we can provide. https://t.co/GWm4B1kVA5 Hateful acts or discrimination against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders have no place in America and must be condemned. Talked to @GriffJenkins on my border trip to El Paso this week.

We had the opportunity to talk to some of the people who were apprehended, &amp; they all told me the same thing, which is that they‚Äôre going to continue to try to come for the better economic opportunities in the USA. https://t.co/cG02ZYBXqn More children &amp; their families are making the dangerous trip north overwhelming the immigration system. Policy changes are needed. https://t.co/kP4i2yTzOY I heard from multiple agents during my trip to the border that they are concerned about the rapid increase in unaccompanied children, up 62% from Jan to Feb, and only expected to grow as we head into the warmer months. After seeing the crisis at our border firsthand, it's evident that we must step up efforts to collaborate w/ international partners - esp. Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras &amp; El Salvador - to discourage migration &amp; provide safer alternatives to making the dangerous journey north. https://t.co/cA96ZJIcAq Looking forward to joining @FaceTheNation with @margbrennan tomorrow morning to talk about what I saw on along the border in Texas and New Mexico on Thursday &amp; Friday. https://t.co/RNnRnNdPLM I want to thank every hard-working member of the U.S. Border Patrol as they deal with the growing crisis at our southern border. 

We owe them the resources to do their job effectively and to help retain the many well-trained agents who serve. https://t.co/IctWSeCSUY The crisis at our southern border is clear. The Border Patrol needs more resources to do their jobs safely &amp; effectively. https://t.co/9DkX8nN06t During my trip to El Paso this week, I visited an area near the Monument Three border section &amp; was able to see the difference between the new wall sections &amp; temporary wall sections left unfinished due to the Biden Administration‚Äôs executive order. https://t.co/7J09A5wyDv However, I‚Äôm deeply troubled by the urgent crisis on our southern border due to the influx of unaccompanied kids and Border Patrol‚Äôs urgent need for increased support and resources.¬†Urging the Biden admin to address this crisis¬†now. I appreciated yesterday's bipartisan southern border visit¬†to see housing and processing facilities for unaccompanied children¬†as well as El Paso border crossing facilities with @SecMayorkas. https://t.co/mhcjHi67nr Today, Border Agents told me that Paso del Norte processing facility is seeing an increase in migrants of 150 to 200% which is stretching manpower &amp; resources thin. 

CBP is struggling to retain agents as they deal with this overwhelming surge in migrants. https://t.co/Pqw71uc0oD It was alarming to see the number of migrants who attempted to cross the border in the short time that we were there. One young man noted that they will never stop trying to find a way across."
"Reed, Jack",SenJackReed,jackreed2020,Rhode Island,Rhode Island,Senator," I cosponsored @maziehirono's COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to help #StopAsianHate. The bill just advanced on a 92-6 vote in the U.S. Senate. No community is immune to hate &amp; intolerance, but we must all do our part to speak out against it &amp; help spread kindness and understanding. As Muslims around the world prepare to celebrate Ramadan, I want to thank Rhode Island‚Äôs vibrant Muslim community for their many contributions to our state, and wish them a safe and happy #Ramadan! Hard work pays off. Congrats on a great career, #11! Thanks for scoring more than one for the scrappy little guy.
https://t.co/Tn209jzco9 COVID-19 vaccines are safe &amp; effective. When you get vaccinated it helps you, as well as those around you.
Starting tomorrow, all RIers 40 &amp; over will be eligible for #COVIDvaccine appointments. The following Monday, April 19, ALL RIers16 &amp; older will be eligible. #GetVaccinated Thanks to all the vaccine clinic volunteers who are rolling up their sleeves to help.

But to really prevent gun violence, Congress needs the courage to act. Bipartisan proposals exist, but too many in the GOP are preventing these commonsense #gunsense measures from getting an up of down vote.
https://t.co/CoQGMyenft Theaters, concert halls, &amp; entertainment spaces are economic force multipliers: bringing people, jobs &amp; opportunity together. They tell important stories &amp; help us stay connected. #SaveOurStages funds will help RI venues stay afloat until they can raise the curtain once more. https://t.co/upOjHEwXBE We are heartbroken over the loss of Officer Evans and send our deepest condolences to his friends, families, colleagues, and loved ones.
https://t.co/0mUrvNUUf7 I'm so grateful to the U.S. Capitol Police and so deeply saddened &amp; angered by the senseless killing of one our brave USCP Officers today. We still don‚Äôt know all the details, but we do know one dedicated officer gave their life &amp; another was wounded protecting the U.S. Capitol. Thrilled to deliver $350,000 federal grant to help upgrade the Jamestown Library. This #publiclibrary is a critical community asset that serves the people of Jamestown in so many ways. This $$$ will support JPL's modernization plan so it can meet growing needs now &amp; in the future https://t.co/TQfbXqzNlS Today is #WorldAutismAwarenessDay &amp; it‚Äôs a great day to show love for our friends who experience #autism &amp; help spread awareness, acceptance, and understanding.

https://t.co/EG16c6iEPs From fighting fires to emergency medical response calls to vaccine distribution, the Little Compton Fire Department does it all. So grateful to our firefighters &amp; first responders. Pleased to deliver federal #AFG funds for the purchase of new power stretcher systems &amp; safety gear https://t.co/353vXA4Mmp Paid a visit to @gform‚Äôs manufacturing facility in North Smithfield this week to get a firsthand look at some of their innovative, protective gear products &amp; solutions and to discuss efforts to connect local #smallbiz w/ federal contracting opportunities. https://t.co/D3q3px55CF Not unusual for Chuck to be at @BugJarRochester. He‚Äôs a big music fan! He &amp; I recently saw @ladygaga &amp; @JLo together.

https://t.co/miB1ZNsQJT Joined Cranston leaders, including @MayorKenHopkins @AnieceG @BrandonPotterRI &amp; more, in solemn remembrance of those who have lost their lives to #COVID19 &amp; those whose lives have been forever changed by this pandemic. We keep them in our hearts &amp; look out for one another. https://t.co/hCoAI7A575 Congrats to @Sabina_Matos on Lt. Gov nom. &amp; kudos to @GovDanMcKee for making this historic choice. Ms. Matos has a strong record of advocating for the people of #PVD. She is a proven leader, thoughtful listener, &amp; real problem solver who will be a strong voice for all RIers. Transit is a lifeline. Warren provides free bus service to safely &amp; reliably connect seniors &amp; residents w/ disabilities to medical appointments, grocery shopping, &amp; more. Proud to work w/ local officials to deliver $40k federal grant for a new #seniorbus to improve service. https://t.co/0Si6if000w RI's community health centers are stepping up to ensure vulnerable RIers can get vaccinated. Pleased to work w/ @SenWhitehouse @JimLangevin @davidcicilline to deliver $33.5M to accelerate vaccine delivery &amp; give everyone a shot at a healthier future.
https://t.co/KL5SWxXJIT As we approach #Passover &amp; #Easter holidays, we are once again filled with a spirit of hope &amp; renewal. As you celebrate with family &amp; friends in faith &amp; fellowship, please remember to help protect one another from #COVID19 so that more may gather together in the future. 90% of Americans support #universalbackgroundchecks on gun sales. It takes 60 votes to bring a bill to U.S. Senate floor. I hope 10+ Senate Republicans will join Democrats in allowing debate &amp; an up or down vote on bipartisan #gunsense measures. Today, we‚Äôre grieving w/ the people of Boulder. Our hearts go out to the victims of this heinous mass-shooting, especially Officer Eric Talley, who gave his life trying to protect others from #gunviolence. We must honor him not only with words, but action.
https://t.co/bx5PkUrQR4 Please join me today at 12:30 to celebrate #WomensHistoryMonth &amp; @WomensFundRI's 20th anniversary. We'll be discussing some of the barriers that have been broken, progress that's been made, &amp; challenges ahead as we seek greater justice &amp; equality for all. https://t.co/WSM1c6e0HG Even St. Joseph‚Äôs Day celebrations are a little different this year. But some traditions never change. With reverence for fathers and workers on this special day, here‚Äôs wishing you a sweet #StJosephsDay filled with good food &amp; family! https://t.co/1Nv3lBZxsg My dream job is serving the people of RI in the U.S. Senate. The desk where I sit &amp; the gavel I bang belongs to them, and I never forget it. I strive to be worthy of their trust &amp; aspire to match the service &amp; commitment of our service men and women.
https://t.co/4p8JroJ3Dy Regardless of who you vote for, I will always stand up for your right to vote. Today, we introduced the #ForThePeople Act to prevent voter suppression, strengthen our democracy, &amp; ensure people‚Äôs voices are not drowned out by special interests and dark money. Happy St. Patrick's Day! Looking forward to the day when we can all gather to celebrate in person. Until then, the march for vaccine progress continues. And before you know it, we'll be marching in Newport, Providence, Pawtucket, West Warwick &amp; everywhere else again. https://t.co/fJyLSdhsEI More vaccine doses are coming in &amp; we‚Äôre making progress. We‚Äôll work non-stop until everybody who wants a shot can get one. For more info about sign ups &amp; eligibility: https://t.co/JGrlIHhb7c Here's a quick video tour to see for yourself what the #COVIDvaccine process is like at Sockanosset Cross Rd site. It‚Äôs safe, simple, &amp; efficient. Even w/ masks on, I can tell folks are smiling here bc they know they're doing their part to help others.
https://t.co/1FNsjLrYoX Getting #COVOD19 vaccine doses to all RIers is a huge team effort. I greatly appreciate all the frontline workers who've chipped in to assist, especially the #CitizenHeroes of @RINationalGuard. I'm here at Sockanosset Cross Rd vaccine site with a simple message: THANK YOU! https://t.co/BTBgf25EiK Restaurant, tourism, &amp; hospitality sectors bring jobs, investment, &amp; opportunity to RI.

RI is set for a major dose of fiscal relief from the #ARP Restaurants add so much flavor &amp; character to our neighborhoods, bringing people together to enjoy good food &amp; cheer. I‚Äôm proud to help bring them some relief. Here at @ChezPascal discussing $28.6B #RestarauntRevitalizationFund to help local eateries &amp; bars. #EatLocal #401Love https://t.co/GfWEcnTkSc It‚Äôs official: Congress just passed the #AmericanRescuePlan! It offers big, bold relief for the American people &amp; communities. Lots of numbers in the bill, but the one that‚Äôs on my mind is 527,000+ of our fellow Americans who‚Äôve been killed by COVID-19. We keep them in our‚ù§Ô∏è's. If you've been working overtime to help out with school work at home, as well educational tech. support, then you will appreciate the #AmericanRescuePlan. It‚Äôs going to help get kids safely back into classrooms &amp; help ensure everyone, including teachers, can get vaccinated ASAP. The worldwide struggle for gender equality continues. Too many women remain without access to equal rights &amp; freedom under the law. This #InternationalWomensDay, we must #choosetochallenge inequality &amp; fight for opportunity&amp;inclusion for all women &amp; girls in U.S. &amp; across the üåé. Visited the marvelous Ms. Phyllis Antonelli of Pawtucket today w/ @MealsRI #MarchForMeals. Today‚Äôs menu featured meatloaf, mashed potatoes, &amp; zucchini. Also proud to help deliver $750M from the #AmericanRescuePlan to help #MealsOnWheels continue serving those in need nationwide. https://t.co/WJjeAyMDXQ The #AmericanRescuePlan will:
‚úÖ Put money in people‚Äôs pockets. 
‚úÖ Boost vaccines &amp; get more life-saving doses into people‚Äôs arms.
‚úÖ Safely reopen schools.
‚úÖ Get people working again &amp; help Main St. businesses survive.
‚úÖ Deliver overdue aid to states &amp; communities nationwide. Great to be on hand to witness the ceremonial inauguration of @GovDanMcKee, the 76th Governor of Rhode Island. Today‚Äôs ceremony may have been socially distanced, but it was certainly memorable &amp; meaningful. As Gov. McKee put it: ‚ÄúIn 2021, let‚Äôs stay positive &amp; test negative.‚Äù https://t.co/ZnJ9rv0XVo With deep gratitude to all the families, frontline workers, doctors, nurses, first responders, &amp; everyone who has sacrificed to protect others during this pandemic: Help is coming. The #AmericanRescueAct is one step closer to providing overdue assistance.
https://t.co/UNiU3NKnpq Secretary Raimondo is an exceptional leader, a devoted public servant, and someone who never forgets her roots. She‚Äôs still the same earnest, kind, hardworking person. And she‚Äôll continue making us proud. Congrats again, Madame Secretary!
https://t.co/lQy0MFbBHo GOOD NEWS: 9,100 doses of J&amp;J single-shot vaccine enroute to RI &amp; should be available for RIers soon. 
Also, next week, @RIHEALTH getting an extra 1,170 doses of Pfizer vaccines, boosting RI‚Äôs weekly shipment of Pfizer + Moderna shots up to a total of 24,840 doses. BREAKING: The U.S. Senate just voted 84-15 to confirm @GovRaimondo as Secretary of @CommerceGov. This means she will soon assume the Commerce Department‚Äôs top job &amp; paves the way for @LGDanMcKee to become RI‚Äôs 76th Governor. Congrats &amp; best wishes to both! The ayes have it 84-15: This was a strong, bipartisan vote of confidence in Gov. Raimondo to lead Commerce Dept. It sets up final confirmation vote tomorrow, paving the way for her to be sworn in as the next Secretary of Commerce. Congrats soon to be #MadameSecretary! The U.S. Senate is getting set for a key ‚Äòcloture‚Äô vote on @GovRaimondo to lead @CommerceGov. If tonight‚Äôs vote succeeds (&amp; it will!) then Governor Raimondo will soon become Secretary Raimondo. The final vote on confirmation would likely take place sometime tomorrow. When it comes to #COVID19, please do not let down your guard! We‚Äôre making real progress w/ #vaccine. But transmission rates of new variants are alarmingly high &amp; there‚Äôs been an uptick in cases over the last 3 days. Please keep doing your part to protect yourself &amp; others. https://t.co/NuNoYOruvp The House approved a COVID-19 relief package to boost vaccine distribution &amp; extend critical federal support for families, schools, #smallbiz, jobseekers, &amp; communities nationwide. I‚Äôm working to pass it in the Senate &amp; ensure RI gets its fair share. https://t.co/omT2OZdxpT To all the LGBTQ+ Americans out there, especially young people: Live your truth. Be proud of who you are. You deserve equal treatment under the law. Together, we will work to pass the #EqualityAct, prevent discrimination, and build a brighter, more inclusive future. Kudos to @davidcicilline for leading the US House in passing the #EqualityAct! David‚Äôs bill would protect LGBTQ+ Americans from discrimination in employment, education, &amp; more. I'm proud to support the Equality Act in the Senate, and hope we can finally get it passed into law. Good news: RI will get another increase in #vaccine doses next week, about 1,000 more. Glad Pres Biden is pushing the private sector to boost COVID-19 vaccine supply. We'll keep at it to ensure everyone who wants a shot can get one as soon as possible. From computer chips to energy to vaccines, PPE, &amp; more, President Biden‚Äôs executive order to help create more secure supply chains for vital goods will also help strengthen U.S. economy &amp; make it more resilient while reducing U.S. dependence on China.
https://t.co/ggGRCCDPlz Collectively, we feel immeasurable sorrow. Losing half a million people like this is absolutely devastating. But we carry them in our hearts &amp; we have a responsibility to shape a brighter future. We must each do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
https://t.co/zcHtZemOup All who believe in our democracy and the Constitution are grateful to @CapitolPolice officers who protect &amp; defend the U.S. Capitol complex &amp; our democracy. We must continue to gather information &amp; learn the right lessons from Jan. 6 Capitol assault.

https://t.co/pINEThLTtD The heartbreak is still with us every day. We keep the #StationFire victims in our hearts &amp; admire the strength &amp; grace of those whose dedication turned tragedy into change &amp; gifted RI a place to reflect in solemn remembrance. Not only for 1 day. Always.
https://t.co/Ph6Uma2oIE This week, I dropped by the East Greenwich Fire Station to salute our firefighters &amp; celebrate some new equipment they received with the help of a federal grant. Thank you to all our brave #firefighters for the incredible work you do!
https://t.co/QA273iMkCQ The U.S. formally rejoined the #ParisAgreement today &amp; reclaimed leadership on #climateaction. #ClimateChange threatens our nat'l security, public health, economy &amp; environment. Today's move is a positive step for people, businesses, the planet, &amp; coastal states like RI. Getting set to speak at the Cranston Public Library on Facebook Live now:
https://t.co/j7884xFclY Bob Dole is a true patriot who fought for what he believed in on the battlefield &amp; in the halls of Congress. Very few have done so with such courage &amp; distinction. I wish him well in this next battle. He has my enduring gratitude, friendship, &amp; respect.
https://t.co/MIhBNpHV8M Here's what it looks like when you successfully complete a 292-million-mile road trip. Congrats @NASA!  And now a new round of hard work &amp; discovery begins.
https://t.co/SUZeGryRXL Icy storms are no joke &amp; we feel for our friends &amp; fellow citizens in TX &amp; OK who've been hit hard by winter weather &amp; are struggling w/ lack of power &amp; water problems too. Glad that President Biden is sending help. Stay safe! I voted. Early in-person voting has begun for RI‚Äôs March 2nd statewide referenda election that includes issues like #infrastructure, #childcare, #cleanwater, #affordablehousing &amp; more. Get informed &amp; make your voice heard. #BeAVoter https://t.co/d75sjorP78 Deeply saddened by the passing of Judge Wiley. His exemplary talent, skill, and leadership stood out. He was a star. As a soldier, a jurist, a civic leader, and all around gentleman, he gave so much to our community and made RI a better place.
https://t.co/pbdSECYIEf Donald Trump betrayed our democracy and systemically incited insurrection. Today, I voted with 56 other U.S. Senators to declare his guilt. While there wasn‚Äôt a 2/3 majority, I‚Äôm grateful to the 7 Republicans who crossed party lines to acknowledge Trump's wrongdoing. Thank you, Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman. 
Great man. 
His heroic actions that fateful day saved lives. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor Congress can bestow and he certainly earned it.
https://t.co/zUjti26rDp COVID vaccines are safe &amp; help save lives. I‚Äôm proud RIers are well-informed, #1 national leaders when it comes to willingness to get vaccinated when it‚Äôs their turn. And I will continue working to help speed more #COVIDVaccine doses to RI.
https://t.co/zjl09vciW0. Under the current state &amp; local aid proposal that is advancing through the legislative process, $1.1 billion would go to RI &amp; $594 million would flow to our cities &amp; local gov‚Äôts. Still more work to be done, but positive momentum.
https://t.co/xPdTWPyrsR I was deeply impressed by @davidcicilline‚Äôs impassioned, articulate, and above all fact-based presentation today. He made a compelling case.
https://t.co/IUAgTLcIM0 Remember: Trump WAS IMPEACHED, ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS, by the House of Reps WHILE HE WAS STILL A SITTING PRESIDENT. Sen. GOP leaders could have expedited the Senate trial, but chose not to. Now the Senate must do its duty, carefully examine the evidence, &amp; render a just verdict. Trump‚Äôs 2nd impeachment trial began w/ debate on whether it‚Äôs #Constitutional to hold this trial after Trump left office, or if Presidents should be immune from this process if their offenses occurred during final days in office. The Senate voted Trump may be held accountable. Congratulations to Kathleen Hicks on her historic confirmation as the new Deputy Secretary of Defense!
https://t.co/Fjboo5dhD2 Trump was weak on #COVID &amp; weak on jobs. He inherited a roaring economy &amp; talked a big game when times were good. But his feeble pandemic response cost both lives &amp; jobs. Data shows we're still in a #jobcrisis &amp; we need strong leadership to turn it around. https://t.co/QdyoJdNLIw @josephrcerami @josephcollins77 Thanks for the kind words. Hope you and your family are well! @SethMagaziner @USSenate Thank you! Guess it‚Äôs time to update my e mail signature.
https://t.co/jLS8SJlwgS Just paid my respects to fallen hero Officer Brian Sicknick, who died in the line of duty while defending the U.S. Capitol from a violent mob. Our hearts are w/ his family &amp; friends &amp; I am grateful to law enforcement &amp; those who defend our democracy.
https://t.co/2OFo9x0JZ3 Welcome to the Senate Armed Services Committee, @SenMarkKelly! As a former @USNavy Captain and @NASA astronaut, I know you will bring a unique &amp; insightful perspective to the committee while also continuing the proud tradition of having a strong voice for Arizona on the panel. I'm pleased @SenJackyRosen is joining @SASCDems! She is a tremendous advocate for Nevada, has deep computer and cyber expertise, &amp; will be a true champion for the brave men &amp; women of the U.S. Armed Forces &amp; for all of  Nevada‚Äôs military bases and installations. The U.S. Senate voted to confirm @AliMayorkas to lead @DHSgov. Secretary Mayorkas is endorsed by law enforcement, experienced (served in #2 role at #DHS) &amp; will play a critical role in keeping Americans safe. He will be the first Latino, as well as the 1st immigrant, to lead DHS. Welcome aboard our newly confirmed Secretary of Transportation @PeteButtigieg! Great to have Secretary Buttigieg leading @USDOT into the future. I look forward to working w/ him to upgrade our nation‚Äôs infrastructure &amp; strengthen our economy. I‚Äôve worked for years to boost RI‚Äôs workforce &amp; help safeguard the nation. The next-gen. submarines built in RI are a big part of that effort. Today, I joined @GDElectricBoat to discuss plans to ramp up hiring @QuonsetRI &amp; add 2,000 new jobs in RI &amp; CT.
https://t.co/tIBJvwLr3L #BlackHistoryMonth is an opportunity to honor the countless contributions of Black Americans to U.S. history &amp; culture &amp; build a more inclusive future. Trailblazers like John Carter Minkins deserve recognition for their invaluable contributions to society.
https://t.co/vlapBFGKT6 Amidst a frigid winter &amp; raging pandemic, I led 43 U.S. Senators in calling for additional lifesaving #LIHEAP utility assistance. LIHEAP is a critical lifeline for over 30K RIers that helps them save on energy bills &amp; boosts our economy. https://t.co/zyIJEvfMMy People experiencing homelessness need protection from the elements &amp; the pandemic. New federal funding will assist with housing &amp; supportive services for RIers in need &amp; help protect public health.
https://t.co/ghd7p7JMyI As temperatures drop, we want everyone to stay safe &amp; warm. Grateful to our public #libraries for stepping up to serve as temporary, socially-distanced warming centers. For a warming center near you, &amp; storm preparedness tips, visit @RhodeIslandEMA: https://t.co/aeNxeOWeTR Had a chance to check out the @FarmFreshRI Winter Market at #10SimsAve today.

https://t.co/tFixXzbDXI The #COVID19 virus is mutating &amp; adapting in ways that could accelerate the spread. We can‚Äôt have a repeat of Sen. Republicans blocking progress for partisan reasons &amp; letting more Americans suffer. Time for GOP to drop the Trump fa√ßade that made the pandemic worse &amp; get to work. .@SenWhitehouse is a force of nature on #climatechange. His leadership &amp; tenacity spurred action to confront climate change. Today he's delivering his last #TTWU floor speech &amp; opens a new chapter that will help lead to more solutions &amp; progress addressing climate change. Today is the 76th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. #WeRemember. We educate. We stand up for truth. We speak out against hate &amp; anti-Semitism. #Auschwitz76
https://t.co/8Qig5HunQm A truly landmark acquisition. This transfer to @NatlParkService is critical to preserving a nationally significant historic site &amp; helping #BlackstoneValley realize its future economic development potential. Thanks to all who made it possible!

Spoke w/ incoming @USTreasury Sec. @JanetYellen today about need to #GoBig to #ControlCOVID, #FixOurEconomy &amp; #GetAmericaWorkingAgain. Wise federal investments now will help rescue families, businesses, &amp; jobless Americans &amp; set the course for strong, sustainable economic growth. @JoeySantes We are literally outside their hotel. Trip Advisor gave it 4.5 stars. Saddened by the passing of Hank Aaron, a true American legend. He was a supremely talented ball player &amp; supremely humble man of uncommon grit, grace, &amp; decency. Long live the #HomeRunKing. May his example &amp; memory be a blessing.
https://t.co/90pGz4o0dN Grateful to all the members of @USNationalGuard who deployed to the U.S. Capitol region to support a safe inauguration &amp; defend our democracy. Had a chance to meet w/ Airmen &amp; Soldiers from @RINationalGuard today to thank them in person. https://t.co/FMTj7nXXhD https://t.co/w1U7X9cWZJ https://t.co/XrB1QgIJIh 93-2: Sec. Austin is a trailblazer who has once again made history. His ability, integrity, &amp; dynamic leadership earned him a place atop the Pentagon hierarchy. At every step of his career he‚Äôs been a team builder who focuses on the mission, leads by example, &amp; gets the job done. Joe Biden spoke from the heart about rising to meet the moment. His speech achieved that aim. Now we must go forth to repeat that feat, not just rhetorically, but with sustained action, each and every day.
https://t.co/uZ8RGlbhwr Today is a unified celebration of the peaceful transition of power to a new President &amp; Vice President and a new Administration. It will take all Americans working together to help our nation thrive. Pleased to be w/ my friend &amp; colleague @SenatorWicker on this historic day. https://t.co/wKoX4bNYyx Good morning! And #HailToTheNewChief After inaugural festivities, the Senate will convene at 4:30pm. Following the prayer &amp; pledge, Senator-designate Alex Padilla &amp; Senators-elect Jon Ossoff &amp; Raphael Warnock will be sworn in. The Senate will have a 50-50 split, w/ VP Harris breaking the tie. Hence, a new majority. So proud that my friend &amp; former colleague @KamalaHarris will be sworn in as the first woman, first Black American, and first person of Indian descent to hold the office of Vice President of the United States. Can't wait to officially say: Congratulations, Madame Vice President! I have had the honor and good fortune to call Joe Biden my friend &amp; colleague. Joe is someone you can always count on &amp; who will always shoot you straight. Tomorrow, it will be my distinct pleasure to address him as Mr. President! Big day tomorrow! COVID-19 &amp; security restrictions will make this inauguration unique, but no less special or historic. Ceremony starts at 11am. At exactly 12 noon, Joseph R. Biden will be sworn in as @POTUS and then Kamala D. Harris will be sworn in as @VP of the United States. Today, the U.S. Senate adopted a resolution honoring the memory of fallen Capitol Police Officer Brian David Sicknick for his selfless acts of heroism on January 6, 2021. Officer Sicknick &amp; his family will be in our thoughts &amp; we are grateful to all who defend our democracy. https://t.co/naEhxBbvV0 It was great to join @WRWC &amp; so many volunteers today to help clean up our community as part of the MLK National Day of Service! #MLKDay21 #MLKDayOn https://t.co/biOTPZYcNB Today would‚Äôve been Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King‚Äôs 92nd birthday.

And every day we strive to live up to his example. #MLKDay2021 https://t.co/i4X1upiZfR 2,000 is another sad milestone. The tragic loss of life is unfathomable &amp; unforgiveable &amp; the grief is immeasurable.

Our hearts go out to his family &amp; many friends. Rest in peace, Congressman. 
https://t.co/ydIwcXMofO In a clear, bipartisan rebuke of Donald Trump, the House impeached him for attempting to incite violence and reverse a free, fair, and properly-certified election. My statement: https://t.co/g2Mf3Eq8rm Americans are united in defending #FreeSpeech. But threatening to hang VP, erecting a noose on the Mall, then unleashing a violent, armed mob into U.S. Capitol is NOT protected speech. The threat of further violence is real. Good people must recognize, condemn, &amp; act to stop it. Blame for the violent assault on our democracy lies w/ those who spread phony conspiracies &amp; failed to refute Trump's lies or hold him accountable. Many in GOP enabled falsehoods to fester. Now, GOP must come clean about Trump‚Äôs lies &amp; uphold truth, justice, &amp; the rule of law. We've got to care for the sick &amp; keep people &amp; communities healthy. That's what Community Health Centers do every day. Joined @ProvidenceCHC @Jorge_Elorza @Sabina_Matos &amp; and Merrill Thomas today to break ground on PCHC Atwood &amp; I will continue working to help #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/9vAUNELq8G Deeply saddened by the death of Officer Brian Sicknick, a veteran &amp; 12-year officer in the U.S. Capitol Police, who was killed while defending the U.S. Capitol from a violent mob.

https://t.co/qUY62cyYf4 Congrats to @GovRaimondo for being tapped to lead @CommerceGov! Governor Raimondo has made a positive difference for RI and now she will be a positive force for the nation! My statement: https://t.co/sfRv6bmq2e Getting set to reconvene &amp; get back to work doing our jobs &amp; working on behalf of the American people. I'm safe &amp; determined to defend our democracy from these heinous attacks. This violent mob, incited by Trump, breached the Capitol, but our work continues &amp; our principles endure. They will not destroy our democracy, undo the election, or subvert the will of the American People! Throughout this pandemic, RI‚Äôs #firefighters have demonstrated great courage &amp; commitment to protecting the community in so many ways. Today I held an online #AFG Workshop with about 50 RI Fire Depts. to discuss federal grants, but also to deliver a simple &amp; profound: Thank you! Thank you to the people of Rhode Island for trusting me to be your U.S. Senator. I am honored to serve you. I will continue striving to be worthy of your support, uphold our shared values, defend the Constitution, &amp; make a positive difference for our great State &amp; the Nation. https://t.co/z7vJ9PpsjI Which of these mathematical facts is true?
¬†
A.) 81,283,485 &gt; 74,223,744
B.) 306 &gt; 232
C.) 51.4% &gt; 46.9%
D.) All of the above
¬†
The correct answer is D. The facts will be upheld on January 6 and we will have a new POTUS on January 20 at 12 noon. Congress just overrode Trump's veto &amp; #FY21NDAA is now law. 
 
Trump tried to make this vote a loyalty test &amp; an overwhelming majority of U.S. Senators demonstrated their loyalty is to the common defense &amp; to the men &amp; women of the U.S. Armed Forces who help defend our nation. The U.S. Senate just voted 80-12 to end debate on veto override of the National Defense Authorization Act (#NDAA). Clearing this procedural hurdle sets up a vote on final override of Pres Trump‚Äôs veto of this crucial &amp; bipartisan bill to provide for the common defense. It‚Äôs the last day of 2020. Hope you and yours stay healthy, warm, and safe. Cheers to brighter days ahead and more time together in 2021! #HappyNewYear #HappyNYE Let‚Äôs be clear: Neither Pres Trump nor Sen. GOP leaders actually want Americans to get $2,000 COVID-19 relief payments. If they did, those checks would already be in the mail. The House acted. The Senate has the votes. The only thing stopping this is a bunch of Sen. Republicans. No, no, no. Not even close to being true. It‚Äôs sad that Pres Trump tries to blatantly spread falsehoods like this, but at least it exposes the fact that his ‚Äúcase‚Äù has no merit whatsoever.
https://t.co/XhARHDvyGK Pres Trump‚Äôs reckless veto of the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act (#NDAA) was easily overridden by the House. Now the U.S. Senate must follow suit &amp; provide for the common defense. As lawmakers cast their vote to override Trump‚Äôs veto of overwhelmingly bipartisan NDAA tonight, keep a sharp eye on who is willing to provide for the common defense &amp; who is willing to #DefundTheMilitary. Now the U.S. Senate must act!
https://t.co/IqBclcysXQ Today, members of Congress will have a chance to show their commitment to U.S. troops &amp; working families with action, not just talk. I urge the U.S. House of Representatives to vote to override Trump's reckless #NDAA veto &amp; approve larger direct payments of $2,000 for Americans. Trump's veto of bipartisan NDAA weakens nat‚Äôl security &amp; blocks U.S. from strengthening our cyber defenses amidst an unprecedented &amp; ongoing cyber intrusion. He's contradicting his own officials regarding Russia‚Äôs probable role &amp; parroting Putin's anti-democracy nonsense."

Why then are responsible states like Idaho barred from providing tax relief under Democrats‚Äô $1.9 trillion spending plan?  

https://t.co/eSwsK07LnH This is not a COVID relief bill, it‚Äôs a vehicle for pushing a liberal agenda by building reliance on government through reckless spending.

I was pleased to attend this virtual roundtable &amp; share ideas on the future of #cyber &amp; #nuclear #energy in Idaho. https://t.co/edjUli0NYi Happy #NationalSpousesDay to my wife Vicki. Fifty-two years of marriage &amp; counting ‚Äì here‚Äôs to many more! https://t.co/AY5orBjjnJ These nominees represent some of Idaho's finest young people. I congratulate them on being selected &amp; wish them the very best throughout the admissions process.

https://t.co/YJYdMpkFjU This is the sad reality:
 
""We've got guys that haven't worked in months, and in some cases years, and to have a project of this magnitude canceled, it's going to hurt a lot of people, a lot of families, a lot of communities.""

https://t.co/C3cubj9GFq I had the pleasure of working with @Dr_Mark_Peters during his time at @INL. Congratulations on your new role &amp; I wish you nothing but success! https://t.co/WBRgYd1vsD Incredibly proud of these men &amp; women! https://t.co/ugJvC7RdIE On the anniversary of Roe v. Wade we remember the millions of lives lost to abortion.

I am proud to have received another A+ rating from @SBAList &amp; will continue to fight for the unborn. https://t.co/1yalcjXpog The new admin has blocked construction of the #Keystone XL Pipeline. This move is flat wrong.
 
Stopping construction will terminate thousands of jobs in the middle of a pandemic &amp; leave us dependent on the likes of #OPEC and #Russia.

https://t.co/9w5iAIRh7W As a former Commander in Chief of the Idaho National Guard, I‚Äôm humbled and thankful to all of you for your service. Thank you for being here, and God bless you. https://t.co/WRUZ1nauT0"
"Romney, Mitt",MittRomney,,Utah,Utah,Senator," My Democrat friends decry the last president for weakening our institutions with his words and behavior but they now cheer the effort to pack the Supreme Court and end the Senate filibuster, which would forever diminish institutions at our Republic‚Äôs foundation. The media had a responsibility to go behind the political rhetoric about the Georgia voting law and provide analysis &amp; truth. Instead, most spread partisan disinformation and inflamed passions &amp; division, further blurring the line between social media &amp; a responsible free press. Blessed to be spending this Easter with my family. https://t.co/AN19J3UJGh ‚ÄúHe is Risen!‚Äù Glorious words of hope and faith for me and for millions upon millions around the world. Profound gratitude for those who protect our nation‚Äôs Capitol and who keep us safe, and profound sadness for Officer Billy Evans who has lost his life doing so. A Senate evenly split between both parties and a bare Democratic House majority are hardly a mandate to ‚Äúgo it alone.‚Äù The President should live up to the bipartisanship he preached in his inaugural address. I‚Äôm humbled by the Kennedy family‚Äôs recognition today. But I see courage every week from my colleagues in the Senate, many of whom make tough decisions to do what they believe is right even though it may be politically unpopular. @JonahDispatch My favorite place in St. George. Glorious indeed! Heartbroken over the senseless shooting in Boulder, Colorado. Ten lives that were taken far too soon, including @BoulderPolice Officer Eric Talley. Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and loved ones, and the entire Boulder community during this time. @JonahDispatch Check out Bear Paw Cafe on N. Main: https://t.co/PZKzmSfTob The Biden administration‚Äôs lack of understanding of the power of incentives continues to baffle me: allowing unaccompanied minors to stay in the U.S. will yield a flood of unaccompanied minors. It‚Äôs de facto ‚Äòchild separation policy‚Äô. The Atlanta shootings are heartbreaking. While the motive is still under investigation, the rising violence and discrimination against Asian Americans is abhorrent. These are our fellow citizens who are weathering the pandemic just like the rest of us. China, under Chinese Communist Party control, does not deserve an Olympic showcase. Let us demonstrate our¬†repudiation of China‚Äôs abuses in a way that hurts the CCP rather than American athletes: an economic and diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics. https://t.co/eJGXYOmQ37 .@thejtlewis Not quite: I voted for President Trump‚Äôs plan‚Äîit was $900 billion and it passed in December. And I oppose President Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion plan, which is why I, along with 9 other GOP senators, have proposed a $600 billion plan instead. https://t.co/DExwuuyGIr Senator Bob Dole has dedicated his life to serving our country. For many of us, he defines the greatest generation. Ann and I will be praying for Bob, Elizabeth, and their loved ones as they face this next challenge. https://t.co/xFOCoq2VCj Arne cared intensely about the many thousands of his colleagues around the world. I will miss his counsel, his warmth and his genuine friendship. With the sudden passing of Marriott International CEO Arne Sorensen, the world‚Äôs largest hotel company loses a leader of vision and achievement. But Arne was not only a brilliant executive, he was also a fundamentally good person. My statement on today‚Äôs impeachment vote: https://t.co/Hfk8yqToPr Lies of a feather flock together: Marjorie Taylor Greene‚Äôs nonsense and the ‚Äúbig lie‚Äù of a stolen election. https://t.co/ID4QL2ZPEV Hold the Tokyo Olympic Games. Athletes have trained a lifetime to be at their peak. Limit in-person spectators‚Äîmost of us watch the Games on TV anyway. The world awaits the inspiration of great competition and global sportsmanship. https://t.co/DtdhKAsur4 Alexei Navalny is the face of courage on the planet, as are the thousands of Russians who stand with him. Every champion of truth and freedom salutes them. Despite the differences Americans may have on matters of policy, we share the common goal of ensuring that America continues to be a beacon of hope and freedom for all. Today‚Äôs #InaugurationDay occurs at a difficult time for our nation. I pray that President Biden will call upon our better angels, uniting the nation at a time of division. Our team prays for strength and comfort for Howie‚Äôs loved ones, his brother and sister officers, and all those whose lives he touched. At his post in the Russell building, Howie was a familiar and cheerful presence, and also a friend to me and my staff, many of whom have known him for years. His bravery, kindness, and genuine care for others was deeply felt by all of us who had the privilege of knowing him. My team and I are heartbroken over the loss of Officer Howard Liebengood, a beloved and dedicated officer who devoted the past 15 years to keeping the Capitol community safe. One of our greatest blessings is that we live in the greatest country on Earth‚Äîand I'm confident that we will rise to meet our challenges in the coming year. May the spirit of peace, joy &amp; hope be with you this holiday season. Ann and I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas. During this holiday season, we pray for our frontline medical workers and first responders, our troops who are serving far from home, and all of those who have lost loved ones to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Christmas comes in the midst of a very difficult year. Despite these challenges, there is reason for hope. From neighbors helping neighbors, to the scientists working nonstop to deliver a vaccine, this year has been full of inspiring examples of compassion and ingenuity. Grateful for the hard work from the medical community, gov. partners, and others who are working around the clock to deliver a safe &amp; effective #COVID19 vaccine. It‚Äôs time for Congress to do its job and finish what our bipartisan group started by passing emergency COVID relief. https://t.co/Zje73g5oRX Sending best wishes to my friend Rob Bishop. Ann and I wish him a speedy and full recovery. And we #givethanks for our healthcare professionals, first responders, teachers, and frontline workers for their tireless efforts during this challenging year. From our family to yours: Happy Thanksgiving! While this Thanksgiving is different than past years for so many families, let us give thanks for our many blessings as Americans. I‚Äôm especially grateful for the men and women who protect our freedoms at home and abroad. I #givethanks for our friends in fur who love us in good times and bad. https://t.co/o32MnCinU5 I am thankful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved. #givethanks https://t.co/2uwGOjoby7 Thankful for the beauty of the earth. #givethanks https://t.co/Jvoilyqcig I am thankful for parents who loved, taught and guided me, who opened my heart to faith, and who lived with integrity and commitment. #givethanks https://t.co/iiKMzqVqNW I am thankful for this woman, who is the love of my life, and for all the joy that this love has brought us, including our youngest granddaughter. #givethanks https://t.co/9bYVnQzyB2 https://t.co/S3kFsIRGmi Ann and I extend our congratulations to President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

Thanks to all the organizers and students who helped with the #VPDebate Pelosi wants feds to borrow $400B to bail out states. Better idea: let states borrow money themselves, perhaps with a federal guarantee (to secure favorable terms) &amp; seniority. Break the stalemate, get a deal done. This is critical for unemployed, small businesses &amp; the economy. Ann and I wish the President and First Lady a swift and complete recovery. Our prayers are with them and all the others who have been afflicted with illness. They got my casual Saturday night look just right at the @BYU game tonight. cc: @danielrainge #GoCougs https://t.co/s66mOwSyHE Happy to hear all is well, Ron! Ann and I will be praying for your speedy recovery. https://t.co/xyaN62ZR6B Fundamental to democracy is the peaceful transition of power; without that, there is Belarus. Any suggestion that a president might not respect this Constitutional guarantee is both unthinkable and unacceptable. My statement on the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg: https://t.co/fFtoOypOrj Never forget the heartbreak of love and lives lost 19 years ago. An outpouring of love today is a fitting act of remembrance. https://t.co/kdl4hYoOla Getting cleaned up for resumption of the Senate.

We had a great time hiking, off-roading and sitting by the camp fire. #beUtahful https://t.co/3LM1sE9SBf Saddened that Herman Cain‚Äîa formidable champion of business, politics and policy‚Äîhas lost his battle with Covid. St. Peter will soon hear ‚Äú999!‚Äù Keep up the fight, my friend. With the passing of John Lewis, America has lost not only a man of history, but a man for our season; O how we need such men of unwavering principle, unassailable character, penetrating purpose, and heartfelt compassion. Unprecedented, historic corruption:  an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president. Congratulations @SpencerJCox on winning the GOP primary in Utah‚Äôs gubernatorial race! Our state has a long history of strong leadership, and I look forward to supporting you in November. Much of who I am is because of the man my father was. Thinking of him‚Äîand all of the values he instilled in me‚Äîtoday. https://t.co/wpxnw9H0Ml Black Lives Matter. https://t.co/JpXUFlxH2J This is my father, George Romney, participating in a Civil Rights march in the Detroit suburbs during the late 1960s‚Äî‚ÄúForce alone will not eliminate riots,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe must eliminate the problems from which they stem.‚Äù https://t.co/SzrcAyfPD8 The George Floyd murder is abhorrent. Peaceful protests  underscore the urgency of addressing injustices. But violence drowns the message of the protestors and mocks the principles of justice. No Americans should fear enmity and harm from those sworn to protect us. The death of George Floyd must not be in vain: Our shock and outrage must grow into collective determination to extinguish forever such racist abuse. I know Joe Scarborough. Joe is a friend of mine. I don't know T.J. Klausutis. Joe can weather vile, baseless accusations but T.J.? His heart is breaking. Enough already. My life has been shaped by the lessons and values instilled in me by my mom, Lenore. And I could not be more proud of the mom that @AnnRomney is to our sons. Happy #MothersDay to all of the moms out there! https://t.co/db6DVEaXPa We've witnessed the incredible strength of mothers during this pandemic‚Äîjuggling working from home with helping teach their kids, all while managing the daily responsibilities that come with being a parent and running a household. .@AmerCompass is helping conservatives rethink how we apply our principles to the problems of today. I welcome their contribution to our national policy debates. https://t.co/iHdOxi59zl #GoCougs! https://t.co/leUSILL16e #GoCougs https://t.co/5jJgvWCPhq He is risen! While Easter services will look different this year, we will celebrate from our homes with praise and profound appreciation for the greatest gift, the greatest miracle, and the greatest sacrifice: Jesus Christ, the Son of God, lives! The Games were arguably the best ever, in large measure thanks to the character and care of Bob Garff. Ann and I will miss our friend very, very much. We send our sympathy and love to dear Kathi. The scandal that surrounded the Games could have overwhelmed our collective commitment, but Bob‚Äôs genuine goodness, clear-eyed optimism, and can-do management experience helped to re-ignite our confidence and community spirit. Bob‚Äôs contributions to our state, to our economy, and to our church will be heralded by many. But for me, it was his sound and principled leadership as the Chairman of the Olympic Winter Games of 2002 that is most compelling. With profound sadness, I have learned that my friend Bob Garff has passed away from COVID-19. It breaks my heart. Thankfully I‚Äôve tested negative for COVID-19. Nevertheless, guidance from my physician, consistent with the CDC guidelines, requires me to remain in quarantine as the test does not rule out the onset of symptoms during the 14-day period. With hundreds of thousands being laid off every single day and employers shutting down‚Äîsome permanently‚Äîthis is no time for Dems to dither, hoping to win corporate social engineering points. Shameful, destructive, and dangerous. As for funds for companies, it‚Äôs to keep entities that employ millions of Americans from folding‚Äîit‚Äôs to save jobs. Keep this up a little longer and we will go from social distancing to social destruction. Nothing in the Senate has shocked me, until today. Standing in the way of a critically needed rescue package is irresponsible and reckless. Dems say not enough money to states: nearly $200 billion isn‚Äôt chump change. Hospitals get at least $75 billion. #InThisTogether https://t.co/0Z97yfCI0U Mr. Rogers: ‚ÄúWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ‚ÄòLook for the helpers.

His work from his bed at home on behalf of his district, state and country is laudable, selfless and greatly appreciated. 3) If you share your home with younger people, divide your quarantine space by creating a barrier with anything you can find, and keep younger folks who aren‚Äôt following a quarantine several feet away from the dividing line. 2) Prepare your own meals at home. If you order delivered meals, have them left on the doorstep by specifying ‚Äúno contact‚Äù delivery and make sure to heat them to kill any germs. Working from home may be impossible for you‚Äîas it is for me in the Senate. But it‚Äôs sure worth a try. 1) Practice strict quarantine. Stay in your home, drive alone in your car, or walk by yourselves outdoors where others aren‚Äôt around. Avoid restaurants, movie theaters, shopping centers, and airplanes. Work from home until we know more. Everyone, especially seniors and those who are health compromised, should take far more restrictive measures than we are right now. Here‚Äôs a checklist from a nurse friend of mine that may be useful for seniors: Re-upping this urgent advice: Seniors &amp; people with compromised health are at greater risk from #COVID19. How much greater? Of the first 803 Italian deaths reported, 98% were 60 or older. Data from other countries also show that older people have a much higher risk of death. Stay well.

Even if you‚Äôre not a senior citizen or in a high-risk group, it‚Äôs critical that you limit social contact as much as possible. Younger people are not immune. It‚Äôs incumbent on younger people to limit the spread and protect our communities. .@CDCgov‚Äôs new guidance advises canceling or postponing any in-person gatherings of &gt;50 people for the next 8 weeks, and advises against gatherings of any size unless using strict precautions. https://t.co/FNkIuXje8W With kids across the country now staying home from school, it‚Äôs especially important for seniors to physically isolate themselves from the rest of the family. Seniors‚Äô high #Covid19 mortality demands high vigilance. All seniors, especially those like me who are over 70, must take every precaution: we are the ones most likely to suffer the most severe complications from COVID-19 that will overwhelm the healthcare system. Please, follow strict social-distancing &amp; even consider self-quarantine. I applaud @Ch_JesusChrist for taking these proactive steps to protect the health of Church members, and their communities. https://t.co/k01YOQqUic I encourage all Americans to register with the @StateDept‚Äôs STEP Program when traveling overseas.

Ann and I will miss our friendship that spanned three decades. https://t.co/BwTMJIMMqG Remarkable and impressive that the invasion of the highly contagious COVID-19 into the US has been delayed.

In this battle with lung cancer, he will face this fight with the same tenacity in which he has delivered his show for the past three decades. Keeping Rush and his family in my prayers. It meant taking no shortcuts and always striving to be the absolute best version of oneself. Praying for his wife, daughters, and loved ones in this difficult time. Heartbreaking news about Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, and all others aboard, all gone from this world far too soon. Kobe‚Äôs ‚Äúmamba mentality,‚Äù which led to so many accolades on the court, was about much more than basketball. America stands with Iranians demonstrating for freedom.

Pretending otherwise is inauthentic and disingenuous. Ann and I are heartbroken for the victims of the horrific attacks in Mexico. Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy. The U.S. must work with Mexican officials to hold accountable those responsible for this senseless violence. While Warren and Sanders push Medicare for All, they apparently haven‚Äôt noticed that Medicare for Some is about to go bankrupt.

When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China‚Äôs investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated. If the President asked or pressured Ukraine‚Äôs president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. .@US_FDA should consider recalling e-cigarettes as it continues to investigate recent deaths and illnesses related to vaping. I‚Äôm increasingly concerned that a generation of young people has been deceived into thinking e-cigarettes are safe. Johnny Isakson has cast a bright beam in our nation‚Äôs Capitol. A man of rare integrity, unwavering honesty &amp; profound character, his work has helped shape American greatness. His decision to retire from the Senate will dim the light of goodness he‚Äôs shed on it for so many years. .@CindyMcCain and the McCain family have created a new way to honor John‚Äôs legacy by encouraging #ActsofCivility. John left this country and this world better off, and this is a wonderful way to keep his spirit and character alive. Today marks one year since the passing of John McCain. Courageous, honorable, driven by a duty to family, country &amp; God, John exemplified the values we as Americans hold so dear. I'm blessed to have called him a friend. May we continue to be inspired by his heroism and character. Iran‚Äôs vicious threats to an American citizen and to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies are further examples of its treachery, its untrustworthiness and its malign intent.

All hat, no cattle. The chants at last night‚Äôs rally were offensive, and I‚Äôm glad the President has disavowed them. People can disagree over politics and policy, but telling American citizens to go back to where they came from is over the line. The president‚Äôs comments were destructive, demeaning, and disunifying. The President of the United States has a unique and noble calling to unite the American people ‚Äì of all different races, colors, and national origins. In that respect, the president failed badly. His selfless leadership and lifelong policy work were critical to the tax and regulatory reform that have helped propel the economy. A man like Paul Ryan does not often come along. The fault for our 2012 loss is mine alone; @SpeakerRyan was a tireless campaigner, fundraiser, and conservative champion. As the sole person who could unite the House, he acquiesced to be Speaker as a service to the country. Congratulations @USWNT on your hard-fought victory! Back-to-back World Champions. Simply amazing. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/FXsChQDzkd The President‚Äôs praise for MBS, the man who US intel says ordered or authorized the heinous murder of a WaPo columnist &amp; Saudi dissident, sends the wrong message to the world.

#DCStatehood is really about packing the Senate with Democrats in order to pass a left-wing agenda.

Just look at the DC voter registration data: 
üîµ 76.4% Democrat
üî¥ 5.7% Republican In Colorado, some are celebrating  #MeatOutDay and cutting meat out of their diet today.

In South Dakota, every day is #MeatInDay unless, of course, it‚Äôs a Friday during lent. Celebrating today by teaching Beckett and Cohen the art of grilling South Dakota beef! https://t.co/rA1UcwMhmA @AustinGossSD Congratulations! I am deeply troubled by the Senate‚Äôs vote today to confirm Xavier Becerra as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services. Mr. Becerra‚Äôs lack of health care experience and extreme views make him the wrong person to lead our nation‚Äôs health department‚Äînow or ever! Russia and Communist China are not acting as our friends. Both are working to undermine the US and the Western Hemisphere. We must work with allies in the region and continue to support democracy.

https://t.co/8ZfpmBcEiV The legislation passed today is not targeted and is not specific, but rather includes many giveaways to left-wing causes. My colleagues and I offered a reasonable conservative alternative that targeted relief to those directly impacted by the pandemic and was one-third the price. Unfortunately, Democrats were unwilling to compromise. This is the first bill that did not pass either chamber with bipartisan support. In fact, it had bipartisan opposition in the House of Representatives. Up until this point, we have always found a way to work together on a bipartisan basis to provide COVID-19 relief for the American people. None of the previous five pandemic relief bills received fewer than 90 votes in the United States Senate. Democrats used the guise of COVID-19 relief to further their left-wing agenda while putting our nation deeper into debt. I voted against this partisan $1.9 trillion spending bill that reads more like a liberal wish list than targeted pandemic relief. Tomorrow is the start of @thesummitleague basketball tournament. Good luck to both South Dakota teams playing in the tournament. I know who I‚Äôm rooting for this weekend! Ôøº

Thanks for being you and for being mine. https://t.co/J47GXeijTK It is now time to get back to the work of the American people. After carefully listening to every minute of the presentations made by the House Managers and the former president‚Äôs legal team, I am convinced that the Senate does not have jurisdiction to render a judgement against the former president. Therefore, I voted not guilty. I‚Äôve said all along that impeaching former President Trump is a moot point as the Constitution is clear that removal from office is the primary purpose of impeachment. Our Founding Fathers intended impeachment to remove public officials from office, not to punish private citizens Clearly you write fiction. I was there for every minute of the impeachment trial and did not leave my seat once during any of the testimony. Every minute. All three days. Please correct your statement. https://t.co/FLGpMTuknl Thanks for having me, @GovMikeHuckabee. The #KeystoneXLPipeline is the most efficient and environmentally sound way to transport petroleum.

I look forward to working with him to address these issues critical to SD should he be confirmed. https://t.co/ugtmIVF9c2 Had a productive talk w/ Ag Sec nominee today. I expressed the need for MCOOL and that we must close loopholes so only beef born, raised and slaughtered in the USA should receive a ""Product of the USA‚Äù label.

Let‚Äôs get this done now. Together, we can take steps toward righting wrongs that have been done throughout our history. https://t.co/Q6TbjiZDzf I agree with my friend @JimInhofe - the defense of our nation is the most important responsibility of the federal government. @POTUS must build on the successes we‚Äôve had the past several years in strengthening our national defense, not relying solely on diplomacy. https://t.co/QSajdoohUR I will work with the agencies to make sure his Executive Order does indeed close loopholes that allow foreign beef to have the USA label ‚Äì this is not only misleading to consumers, it puts our beef producers at a competitive disadvantage. Buying American is great. @POTUS can show he is serious about his proposal by making sure only US beef is labeled ‚ÄúProduct of the U.S.A.‚Äù and by supporting Mandatory Country of Labeling (MCOOL). https://t.co/FzFp5moAG9 The filibuster is a big, fancy Washington word but it really just refers to a historic Senate rule that leads to more bipartisanship and consensus when making federal laws. #NoNuclearOption https://t.co/wqO4dfZwgk The filibuster is an important tool unique to the Senate that leads to bipartisanship and consensus in the making of permanent federal laws.

https://t.co/USzMPKKc7x The attack on 6 Jan was a crime &amp; a disgrace

But the Senate does not have the Constitutional power to convict a former government official no longer in office.  https://t.co/SSkD7sNvnG All this drama for nothing. House managers made fools of themselves. They have agreed to have a news article for the record something they could have gotten without resistance from anyone. If House Managers were acting as lawyers they would have just submitted the article they referenced into the trial record. 

But instead, as hyper-partisans they got caught up overnight by the demands of left wing Twitter and overreached. Senate impeachment trial now in recess because Democrats are trying to figure out a way out of the predicament they put themselves in. 

Their radical base &amp; House Managers want them to muscle through witnesses but block any witnesses for Trump. Now that we are going to have  witnesses no one can claim this is a fair trial unless both sides are now allowed to call them. Last night left wing Twitter starting beating up the managers for not calling witnesses &amp; this morning they caved

By a majority vote the Democrats can now force a trial where the House Managers get their witnesses &amp; former President Trump gets none.

A complete farce Bring out the ü¶ò ü¶òü¶ò Before the mountains were born,the earth and the world brought forth,from eternity to eternity you are God.

Psalms 90:2 If the Senate sets a precedent that a former official can be convicted &amp; disqualified it will be just a matter of time before a future House,under partisan pressure to ‚ÄúLock Her Up‚Äù,will impeach &amp; the Senate forced to try other former officials 

A destructive slipper slope This is great news announced by ‚Å¶‚Å¶@POTUS‚Å©.

But now Biden quietly withdrawn rule proposed by Trump admin to require schools &amp; universities to disclose their partnerships with these agents of Chinese govt influence If this tackle were made by a player it would be flagged for  ‚Äúunnecessary roughness‚Äù for ‚Äúforcibly hitting the defenseless player‚Äôs head or neck area with the shoulder‚Äù

Mark 1:15"
"Sanders, Bernie",BernieSanders,SenSanders,Vermont,Vermont,Senator," Now is the time to think big, not small ‚Äî that means restoring the corporate tax rate to 35%, cracking down on offshore tax shelters, and closing corporate tax loopholes. This would generate at least $2.3 TRILLION to invest in the long-neglected needs of the working class. I happen to believe that when you talk about infrastructure, you've got to talk about human infrastructure. Education. Health care. Childcare. Good wages. Affordable prescriptions. That's human infrastructure. Yes, we have got to rebuild this country's crumbling infrastructure. https://t.co/Fau7ProCdo 20 years of war is enough. 2,500 brave men and women losing their lives is enough. The expenditure of $2 trillion is enough. I applaud what President Biden has done in ending our nation's longest war. https://t.co/LlYsfR7sNk We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to every U.S. and coalition servicemember who served in Afghanistan, and we will never forget the 2,488 U.S. servicemembers who gave their lives there. We also remember the over 100,000 Afghan civilians who have been killed in this war. I applaud President Biden for making the right decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan and bring an end to the longest war in our country‚Äôs history. If we end dozens of tax loopholes, subsidies and other special interest giveaways to big oil, coal and gas companies, we can save taxpayers up to $150 billion over the next decade. Infrastructure means that when mom and dad go to work, their children have high quality child care at a cost working families can afford. Congratulations to the Urban Institute and Brookings staff for for organizing @UrbanInst_Union and @BrookingsUnion with @NonprofitUnion. I hope other workers in nonprofits follow their example and join a union. Now more than ever, we need a strong labor movement for all workers. https://t.co/qlvlHUIE7V Ramadan Mubarak to all our Muslim friends. May it be a month of much peace and joy. Have you or a loved one ever delayed seeing a dentist because of the cost? It is time to expand Medicare to include dental care, eyeglasses, and hearing aids. In America, 75% of seniors who need hearing aids don‚Äôt have one. Why? The average hearing aid costs more than $2,400 and can run as high as $6,000, while 50 percent of seniors are living on a fixed income of less than $2,200 a month. Workers are not simply cogs in a machine. They are not robots. They are human beings who should have some say about what happens to them during the workday. https://t.co/sNI5Uub9n9 We need to broaden our definition of infrastructure. It is, of course, bricks and mortar. But it is also human infrastructure. Now is the time to create millions of jobs addressing the needs of the working class. It is good policy and good politics. https://t.co/eNaAshZT2l The history of every struggle in this country tells us that we do not always win the first time out. But I believe, as a result of their courage, workers in Alabama will inspire significant growth in union organizing efforts around the¬†country. And let's be clear, they were up against a company that was willing to spend vast sums of money and use every kind of tactic there is to defeat them. I support @RWDSU‚Äôs calls for an investigation into those tactics. The willingness of Amazon workers in Bessemer to take on the wealthiest man in the world and a powerful company in an anti-union state is an inspiration. It takes an enormous amount of courage to stand up and fight back, and they should be applauded. https://t.co/vWHyEjnz8P The majority of billionaires have gotten richer since the start of the pandemic. Let me repeat that: 86% of billionaires are now $5.1 TRILLION richer, while some 76 million Americans have lost their jobs. Yes, the time is now to address this obscene level of greed and inequality. It is no great secret that wages have been stagnant in America for many decades. The rich are getting richer, while many workers are working longer hours for lower wages. We've got to grow the union movement. https://t.co/hKVmqMl3vi The U.S. ranks 39th in the world in life expectancy.¬†Yes.¬†Rebuilding our infrastructure is not just roads and bridges. The new reconciliation bill must include protecting the planet, health care, education, housing and providing for the needs of a long-neglected working class. The Republican Party is now trying to appeal to the working class with racist politics, with homophobic politics, and with xenophobic politics. They want to pretend that they are somehow the ""party of the working class."" Let's be totally clear: it is total nonsense. https://t.co/eIq9s8hhic All over this country, what Republicans are doing is trying to protect their own interests by making it harder for people who may vote against them to participate in our democracy. ABSURD! Our job now is to protect and expand voting rights in every state. https://t.co/HUUBoDKk2M What is infrastructure in this country:
‚úÖ roads
‚úÖ bridges
‚úÖ our energy grid
‚úÖ broadband
‚úÖ childcare
‚úÖ dental, vision, &amp; hearing care for the elderly

Now is the time to begin addressing our physical infrastructure as well as our human infrastructure. Let's get it done. When a working class family can't find quality, affordable childcare, that's human infrastructure. When a senior can't afford dental care, hearing aids, or eyeglasses, that's human infrastructure. Our nation must address the human infrastructure that we have ignored for too long. In so many ways, we are behind many other countries throughout the world in providing for working class families, the elderly, and the children. I think right now is the time to begin to address not only our physical infrastructure, but our human infrastructure as well. https://t.co/rAvLkWosy0 The time is long overdue to finally make the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes in this country. https://t.co/1mjxPDRqOn Today, some 53 years on from the day of his assassination, let us not forget for a moment where Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was when he was killed. He was standing with exploited workers in Memphis, Tennessee. That was then, and here we are now. The struggle continues. Cost to consumers:

Nike Air Max 270s: $150

Dish Network basic package: $64.99

FedEx ""large"" box delivery: $20.00

Zoom Pro monthly membership: $14.99

Federal income taxes paid in 2020:

Nike: $0

Dish Network: $0

FedEx: $0

Zoom: $0

Yes. We must end our rigged tax code. We can no longer tolerate a rigged system that allows FedEx to pay nothing in federal income taxes for 3 straight years after making billions in profits while forcing the Postal Service to pre-fund retiree benefits 75 years into the future for workers who haven't even been born. If you paid $120 for a pair of Nike Air Force 1 shoes, you paid more to Nike than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years, while it made $4.1 billion in profits and Nike's founder, Phil Knight, became over $23 billion richer. Yes. We must #TaxTheRich. I want you to think about an America in which we have an explosion of union membership. That's our job ‚Äî together, we must grow the trade union movement all over this country. The only way we deliver real power to working people is by rebuilding the trade union movement. Right now, there are 253 bills in state legislatures that restrict voting rights in 43 states. Losing an election should not mean changing the rules to win the next one. Why are cowardly Republicans so afraid of democracy? We can build an economy that works for all and not just the few ‚Äî but it will take all of us. Power rests with people who are organized and are willing to stand up and fight for their rights. Good. Marijuana should be legal nationwide. All marijuana convictions must be expunged. It is absurd and idiotic that the federal government considers marijuana to be as dangerous as heroin. https://t.co/BZVVO44jic Amazon workers in Alabama are sick and tired of being treated like robots. They are standing up and fighting back, and I am proud to support them. https://t.co/lOuBL8oJK2 In 1978, the top 0.1% owned about 7% of the nation‚Äôs wealth. In 2019, the latest year of data available, they own nearly 20%. I‚Äôm proud to endorse Mayor @ChokweALumumba for reelection because he is a consistent fighter¬†for the working families of Jackson, Mississippi. As Mayor, he has been a strong¬†advocate for justice,¬†progress, and equity. https://t.co/y3kiO1ZP09 Over the course of the pandemic, tens of millions of Americans are out of work. 10 million are behind on rent. 22 million say they don't have enough to eat. But in America today, a handful of billionaires are now $1.3 trillion richer.

This is what a rigged economy looks like. My question for Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos is simple: When you have so much money, more money than can be spent in a million lifetimes, why are you trying so hard to defeat workers who are demanding decent pay and decent working conditions? https://t.co/SON0CVTgGP Jeff Bezos, worth $180 billion, is getting nervous. He's afraid that if Amazon workers in Alabama vote to unionize, it'll give workers all over America the courage to take on his greed &amp; win economic justice. He's spending millions against this union to keep billions for himself. https://t.co/Px1zAtk87z ‚ÄúThe way that we work, it's meant to mentally break you down."" 
https://t.co/4i4MJiy111 I spoke for a few minutes yesterday with Amazon workers in Alabama. They told me about the heat, the absurd breaks, and the fact that if you are one minute late you lose a whole hour of pay. That is why they are standing with courage and taking on the richest man in the world. https://t.co/4i4MJiy111 What Amazon workers in Alabama are doing takes real courage. They are standing up, not only for themselves and their families, but also for exploited workers all across the country who are sick and tired of corporate greed. I am very proud to stand with them. https://t.co/jNviPvSu8W The only way we are going to rebuild the disappearing middle class in America ‚Äì the only way ‚Äì is to rebuild the trade union movement and give workers a seat at the negotiating table.¬†We must organize to pass the PRO Act NOW. 

https://t.co/Lkb7rv5AQY If Amazon workers prevail in forming a union in Alabama, they'll do it in Mississippi. They‚Äôll do it in Tennessee. They‚Äôll do it in Georgia. They‚Äôll do it all over America.

And instead of a race to the bottom, we will see rising living standards throughout the country. This country belongs to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires. What Amazon workers in Alabama are doing is historical. All over this country, people are sick and tired of being exploited, and what this effort says to them is: stand up, fight back. This country belongs to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires. https://t.co/tYwS6JG5jl If history teaches us anything, it is that big money interests do not just give you anything. You've got to stand up and you've got to fight for it. There is no excuse for workers at Amazon not to have good wages, good benefits, and good working conditions. https://t.co/ODguQGAU6Q When you go against one of the largest corporations and you do it alone, you've got no power. But when you stand together in solidarity with each other, you can negotiate for better conditions. https://t.co/VL5bVDDBMT Today, I say to Jeff Bezos ‚Äî who is worth $180 BILLION, a man who has made tens of billions in the last year of this pandemic ‚Äî why when you have so much, are you spending millions trying to defeat the workers trying to win decent working conditions? https://t.co/9hJxG7gikP ""I'm going to say absolutely you should vote for that union.

I hope you can tune in at https://t.co/vreIiWwPgq https://t.co/VeAftDvgLE The time is long overdue for us to address the crisis of income and wealth inequality in our country, and strong, organized worker power is crucial in that fight. I am proud to stand in strong solidarity with Amazon workers in Alabama in their struggle to form a union. When I speak with Amazon workers in Alabama today, my message to Jeff Bezos will be pretty simple. ""Jeff, you're worth $182 billion. That's a lot of money. What is your problem with allowing workers in Alabama to organize for better wages and better working conditions?"" One report found that Jeff Bezos's net worth had grown so much from March to September 2020 that he could have given every single Amazon employee a bonus of $105,000 and he'd still be as wealthy as he was before the pandemic. Outrageous. In 2020, Amazon made $14 billion in profits during the COVID pandemic, but decided to stop paying hazard pay to workers. During that same time, Jeff Bezos saw his wealth grow by around $70 billion. Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, is the wealthiest person in the world and the company has tens of thousands of workers in fulfillment centers all across the country who are working at a breakneck pace to fill and ship orders. Republicans who failed to win the last election are passing laws in an attempt to steal the next election. Absolutely disgraceful. Too many have fought and died for the right to vote. We will not fail them. We must protect and expand voting rights in the United States. If Amazon workers in Alabama can prevail in forming a union, it can be done all over this country.

I hope you'll join me, @KillerMike, and workers in the struggle as we rally tomorrow at 3 PM CT/ 4 PM ET, LIVE from Alabama. Tune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS https://t.co/8ULbG35lR9 The 50 wealthiest people in America today own more wealth than the bottom half of our people.

That is a moral obscenity. I am proud to stand in solidarity with Amazon workers in Alabama who are fighting for better wages and better working conditions. If they win, they will improve the lives of workers at the warehouse in Alabama and all over this country. https://t.co/w3luS3vjyP There are a lot of problems facing our country and facing our economy.

The level of inequality in America is obscene and a threat to our democracy. https://t.co/CbMWYnPFUx CEO pay growth from 1979-2019: 1,167%
Worker pay growth from 1979-2019: 13.7%

Maybe it's a radical idea, but I think it's time we created an economy that looks out for the working people of this country, and not just the CEOs. Every benefit, from the minimum wage to the 5-day work week, was earned when people organized. It‚Äôs never easy. But workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama are standing together right now and if they win, it will send a shockwave throughout this country. https://t.co/4JVvXAPHfJ Tens of millions of Americans are out of work. Half our people are living paycheck to paycheck. 

But hey, a handful of billionaires have another $1.3 trillion in wealth, so that's okay, right? WRONG.

Enough is enough. We have got to create an economy that works for all of us. Right now, women make up 70% of tipped workers, yet they experience 3x the poverty rate as the rest of the workforce. That is an outrage.

Please join me and @onefairwage next Wednesday at 8 PM ET for a conversation with tipped workers on raising the tipped minimum wage. https://t.co/vtiY0CXlGg The average worker in America is now making $32 dollars a week less than he or she made 48 years ago ‚Äì after adjusting for inflation. That is absurd. We are in a moment in American history where two guys ‚Äî Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos ‚Äî own more wealth than the bottom 40% of people in this country. That level of greed and inequality is not only immoral. It is unsustainable. When we talk about rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, we must include low-income and affordable housing. Today, 500,000 Americans are homeless, and 18 million spend 50% of their incomes on shelter. We can create millions of jobs building the housing we desperately need. What will the $1,400 direct payments in the American Rescue Plan mean for you and your family? I happen to think that at the end of the day, to deliver for working people, we have got to end the filibuster. https://t.co/WrsYSd5jXZ I stand with nurses in Madison, Wisconsin who are demanding a safe work environment and paid sick leave. They are on the frontlines in our fight against COVID-19.  We must treat them like the heroes they are. https://t.co/fMtNc36Od2 Let me be clear, we must have the courage to address the crises facing the American people, even if it means taking on the big money interests. Yes, we are off to a really good start. But we must continue to stand up for the working class. https://t.co/qZIoZYPI5n Shock of shocks! After historic voter turnout, the GOP is trying to restrict who can and cannot vote. Cowardly politicians who can only win elections by suppressing the vote need to get out of politics and find a new job. https://t.co/RPgCx6zcxx The American Rescue Plan is the most consequential piece of legislation for working families passed in many decades, and that is because it begins to address, in rather significant ways, the enormous and unprecedented crises they are facing today. https://t.co/khgC0Ul7uf I say to Jeff Bezos, the richest person on the planet: what is your problem with Amazon workers organizing for better working conditions and better pay? You are worth $182 BILLION. You cannot continue to have it all when so many are struggling. https://t.co/2Iqglogg2u We cannot and will not have a moral society when so few have so much and so many have so little. That is the struggle we are engaged in. We must continue to fight for an economy that works for all of us. One year ago, Breonna Taylor was murdered by police officers. It is a disgrace that we are still waiting on justice. The time is long overdue for us to combat systemic racism and a broken criminal justice system. The American Rescue Plan more than doubles funding for community health centers, which means that more working families all over this country will be able to walk into a community health center and get the care they need. That will be transformative for so many. It‚Äôs unfortunate Mr. Bezos won‚Äôt join our hearing. While he‚Äôs become $78 billion richer during the pandemic, families are struggling to survive, so why is he spending a whole lot of money to stop workers from organizing a union at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama? https://t.co/haeBDYHxaz While Senate Republicans told us we cannot afford to provide $1,400 direct payments to the working class, they had no problem introducing a bill this week to repeal the estate tax which would provide a $1.7 trillion tax break to the billionaire class. Total hypocrisy! The American Rescue Plan will
- send $1,400 direct payments to working class adults &amp; their kids
- cut child poverty in HALF
- boost unemployment payments by $300
That is just some of what's in the bill. What a difference it makes when government is on the side of working people. This relief bill is the difference between dignity and despair for millions of America‚Äôs working families. And yet, not a single Republican ‚Äî the so-called 'party of the working class' ‚Äî voted for it! The Republicans have turned their backs on the needs of working families. https://t.co/K4lzs3sUjw The Senate must now take up the #PROAct. The trade union movement is the last line of defense against a billionaire class that won‚Äôt be satisfied until they have it all. https://t.co/CST7gM13kS The $1,400 direct payments in the American Rescue Plan will mean the difference between despair and dignity for millions of people in our country. Finally, our government is responding to the pain of working people. Interesting. The Republican Party claims to be the party of the working class. Yet, according to a recent Pew poll, 63% of lower-income Republicans support the covid relief bill that we just passed - but not one Republican voted for it. They sure LOVE working people. No doubt. To the progressive movement, it is because of your support that we just passed the most significant legislation for working people in decades. Let‚Äôs talk about just a few of the policies in it. https://t.co/6q0VFlp2oc Under GOP control, Congress passed $1.9 trillion in tax cuts mainly for billionaires &amp; corporations. 
Now, after one of the highest voter turnouts in history, we passed $1.9 trillion to help working families who are struggling.
Do not let anyone tell you your vote doesn't matter. What we did is write and pass a bill to address the crises facing the American people, not the wealthy and large corporations. The result is the most significant piece of legislation to benefit the working class in many years. https://t.co/wP91Qe3Mds The American Rescue Plan addresses a crisis that America has ignored for too long: Our childhood poverty rate is among the highest of any major country on Earth. Yes, we are finally going to provide real help for the children of America. https://t.co/q7fYDINnmI In 2017, Republicans passed a tax bill that provides 83% of the benefits to the top 1% &amp; tried taking healthcare away from 32 million people. On Saturday, Democrats voted to provide 86% of Americans with direct payments &amp; cash benefits to 93% of kids. Elections have consequences. Right-wing Republicans in CA are trying to recall @GavinNewsom for the crime of telling people to wear masks and for listening to scientists during COVID. Extremist Republicans have done enough to undermine democracy already. We must all unite to oppose the recall in California. Today, 56 years on from Bloody Sunday, it is absurd that we are still fighting for the right to vote. Not only is it our duty to keep fighting to end voter suppression in all its forms ‚Äî we must also work to expand our democracy and make it easier for all our people to vote. The American Rescue Plan is the most significant piece of legislation to benefit working people in the modern history of this country. https://t.co/bRcOAqJwKG Where was Republicans' concern for the deficit when they gave over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the rich and large corporations? The bill we are fighting for right now is the most significant piece of legislation for working families that Congress has passed in decades. https://t.co/knwAzjYwOn In my mind, the great economic crisis that we face today is half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. And many millions of workers are, frankly, working for starvation wages. Raising the minimum wage is what the American people want, and it's what we have got to do. There is not one state in our country where you can make ends meet on the current federal minimum wage. Not one! How quickly would Congress raise the minimum wage if they were forced to live on $7.25 an hour? Outrageous. There is nowhere ‚Äî I repeat, NOWHERE ‚Äî in the United States where a full-time worker being paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 can make ends meet. That is a disgrace. It is far past time that we raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and give millions of workers a raise. Of the 32 MILLION workers who would benefit from raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour:
- 59% are women
- 31% are Black
- 26% are Latino
This is not just about economic justice ‚Äî raising the minimum wage would significantly narrow the gender and racial pay gap. Let's do it. 40 years ago today, I won my first election to become Mayor of Burlington by just 10 votes. 10 votes. Do not ever let anyone convince you of the notion that your vote does not matter. Your vote matters and we need you to stay involved in the political process. https://t.co/KnmVtyvAh0 I say to the Walton family of Walmart: the American people are sick and tired of subsidizing your greed. Pay your workers a living wage. https://t.co/fO15Fv08wD Why should the taxpayers, many of whom are struggling economically as a result of the pandemic, subsidize the starvation wages being paid at Walmart? The owners of Walmart got $50 BILLION richer during the pandemic. They can afford to pay workers a living wage. At a time when millions of workers are earning starvation wages, when the minimum wage has not been raised by Congress since 2007 and stands at a pathetic $7.25 an hour, it is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. https://t.co/DftFAaESey Sadly, the Republican Party has turned its back on democracy and evolved into an authoritarian party ‚Äì suppressing the vote, pushing big lies and conspiracy theories. Too many Americans have fought and died to defend our democratic way of life. We cannot and will not fail them. Walmart, the largest employer in America, is owned by the richest family in America. Their wealth has gone up $50 billion during the pandemic, and they spend millions on themselves. But the company they own starts workers off at $11 an hour. That is outrageous. https://t.co/NbKkuZjz5a I strongly disagree with the parliamentarian‚Äôs ruling about the minimum wage. But the people are demanding an end to starvation wages in America. We will not give up. We must get this done. https://t.co/qt6mYJU7fl The relief bill is life and death for millions of working families. I‚Äôm LIVE with @PplsAction to talk about how we get it done. https://t.co/LLhMkEgHsC Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would benefit 32 million workers and would give low-wage workers an extra $3,300 a year.

I'll say that again.¬†Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would benefit 32 MILLION workers. Let's get it done. The owners of Walmart, the Walton Family, are the richest family in the country. They're worth $200 billion. They currently pay at least HALF their workers less than $15 an hour. That is absurd. The richest family in America can afford to pay their workers a living wage. https://t.co/Yw7bAJBBUp Let me congratulate the workers at Amazon for having the incredible courage to stand up and to fight for a union. The fight you are waging will send a message to workers all across the country that if they stand up, stand together, and fight, they can win. https://t.co/7cG5v6elCb Some people ‚Äî including Senators ‚Äî say, ""Well, Bernie, how can we afford to act on climate change?‚Äù The real question is: how can we afford NOT to act while climate change causes destruction and suffering? We have a moral obligation to protect the planet for future generations. I‚Äôm proud to support @gilcedillo‚Äôs campaign for reelection to the City Council. He knows that working people built Los Angeles, and he fights every day to make sure their voices are heard over the concerns of the wealthy and the powerful. https://t.co/HsehsIM4zV Cowardly Republicans, afraid of democracy, want to make it harder for people to participate in the political process. What are they afraid of? Our job is to make it easier to vote, increase voter turnout and strengthen our democracy. Together, we will end voter suppression. https://t.co/HVxr7Rldg6 No one can tell me that you¬†can live in dignity on $7.25 an hour. It cannot be done. It is time we¬†finally do what is right, and raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour. No more starvation wages!¬†https://t.co/0mGwm1TiYH I‚Äôm endorsing @JuanForRep for state representative because when he gets to the state house he will put the working people of the 19th district before the needs of special interests and the wealthy. https://t.co/jiRoLJfCDo This is the height of corporate greed. The owners of Kroger choose to shut down stores instead of simply paying the workers risking their lives who make their corporate profits possible. Absolutely despicable.

https://t.co/oFjbKuuTMM When the gap between the very rich &amp; everyone else is widening; when the 50 richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of our country; when the effective tax rate of billionaires is less than that of average workers; YES. We must address income &amp; wealth inequality. Raising the minimum wage is not just about economic justice ‚Äì it is about racial justice. Nearly half of Black and Latino workers in America make under $15 an hour. We must end starvation wages, and give 32 million Americans a raise by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The overwhelming majority of the American people understand that we must end starvation wages in America. That means raising the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour by 2025.¬†Period. https://t.co/Pxh3QbXNG8 Let's be clear. The rich are doing just fine. Billionaires are seeing tremendous growth in their wealth. But working families are living in more desperation than at any time since the Great Depression. Congress has got to move forward vigorously, and help the American people. https://t.co/TU6vyW4OVD Instead of spending billions on 30 second tv ads, Democrats must invest in 12 months a year grassroots organizing around the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. If we build a political movement from the ground on up, we cannot lose. I stand in strong solidarity with fast food workers all over this country who are going on strike today to demand $15 an hour and a union. The Senate must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour with 51 votes this year. We have got to end the crisis of starvation wages in America. Does the Republican Party believe in democracy or the Big Lie and conspiracy theories? That is what Republicans must decide. That is what is at stake. https://t.co/Mx3M1U4Qaz The Covid relief bill when passed is going to do a lot of good for working Americans, but one thing that simply cannot be emphasized enough is that it will cut child poverty IN HALF ‚Äì the biggest reduction in modern history. That's why we must act and act quickly. The impeachment trial was not just about Trump's speech on January 6. It was about whether we remain a democracy or move toward authoritarianism: big lies, racism, divisiveness, violence and one-man rule. That's what the trial was about and that's what 43 Republicans voted for. Thank you @USProgressives for your leadership. The Covid Bill in the House increases stimulus checks to $2000 for the working class, raises the minimum wage to $15 an hour, cuts childhood poverty in half and extends unemployment benefits. The Senate must prepare to act quickly. It is not acceptable that in America today the very rich get much richer, while working families struggle. No more austerity economics. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few. https://t.co/bkMBq5V758 It is truly sad and dangerous that only 7 Republicans voted to convict a president who is promoting a Big Lie, conspiracy theories and violence, and is aggressively trying to destroy American democracy. This is what the Big Lie is all about. Three months after the election, and 61 court decisions later, Trump and his attorneys still refuse to acknowledge that he lost the election. Pathetic. This is about greed ‚Äì plain and simple. Closing down Minor League teams, like the Vermont Lake Monsters, is a disaster for baseball fans, workers, and communities across the country. I will do all I can to fight it. https://t.co/4FC6E2k0si Millions of Americans are trying to survive on starvation wages. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. Inequality is growing. It is a moral imperative to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. We must act NOW. https://t.co/mrdStdnNjD Maybe ‚Äì just maybe ‚Äì instead of listening to the billionaire class we should pass the relief the American people are demanding and desperately need. That‚Äôs what Democrats promised, and that‚Äôs exactly what we must do. Let's get it done. https://t.co/5o43Jg900S It's time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. https://t.co/BlvQ52unvn The Republican Party has a fundamental choice to make. It can be a conservative party that believes in democracy and the rule of law or it can be an authoritarian party that‚Äôs built on conspiracy theories, violence and the Big Lie. But it cannot be both. While the top hedge fund managers made $23 billion in 2020, millions of people struggled to put food on the table for their children and pay their rent. 

It‚Äôs time to rethink our national priorities and finally build an economy that works for all ‚Äì not just the billionaires. https://t.co/xjWXmjPeOK Congratulations to the House Leadership and the Progressive Caucus. It is absurd to create an income eligibility cap that would mean 40 million Americans who got support under Trump wouldn‚Äôt get checks under Biden. Let‚Äôs get this done. 
https://t.co/7T9obKuWr4 I stand in solidarity with Amazon workers in Alabama who are today beginning to vote in a historic union election.

https://t.co/namvkT16zx Jane and I are deeply saddened by the passing of Karen Lewis. She lived her life on the front line of the struggle for justice in education, and to honor her memory we must recommit ourselves to building the fairer future students and families deserve. https://t.co/wmWb35VQCt Let's be clear. We will never get 10 votes from Senate Republicans to pass a $15 an hour minimum wage.¬†The ONLY way we can do it now¬†with 51 votes is through the reconciliation process. It is absurd that some Democrats think we should tell a worker making $52,000 a year that they are ""too rich"" and cannot get the full $2000 benefit we promised. It makes no sense to me, nor do I think it makes sense to the American people. https://t.co/aksYr44pI7 It cannot be overstated how powerful it will be if Amazon workers in Alabama vote to form a union. They are taking on powerful anti-union forces in a strong anti-union state, but their victory will benefit every worker in America. I‚Äôm proud to stand with them. https://t.co/3JtUeAzJOY Unbelievable. There are some Dems who want to lower the income eligibility for direct payments from $75,000 to $50,000 for individuals, and $150,000 to $100,000 for couples.¬†In other words, working class people who got checks from Trump would not get them from Biden.¬†Brilliant! Why would we want to impeach and convict Donald Trump ‚Äì a president who is now out of office? Because it must be made clear that no president, now or in the future, can lead an insurrection against the government he or she is sworn to protect. Walton family wealth in 2018: $146 billion
Walton family wealth in 2021: $228 billion

Walmart minimum wage in 2018: $11 an hour
Walmart minimum wage in 2021: $11 an hour

It is a moral outrage that the richest family in America pays workers at Walmart starvation wages. The budget resolution the Senate passed today puts us on a path to finally raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It is a moral imperative in the richest country in the world that no one is forced to live on a starvation wage, and the American Rescue Plan will get it done. The agenda of the budget resolution passed today is not the agenda of wealthy campaign contributors. It is not the agenda of the billionaire class. It is the agenda of the working people of America and with its passage we are closer to restoring their faith in our government. Not only is the $1.9 trillion emergency COVID-19 relief package the right thing to do from a moral and policy perspective, it is precisely what the overwhelming majority of Americans want us to do.

Let's deliver real relief to working people everywhere. Let's get this done. Tonight, I will be on the Senate floor to get a budget framework for COVID-19 relief passed. 

Republicans, on the other hand, will be offering countless amendments to delay and disrupt this process.

We will not be deterred. We will get this done and deliver real relief. No one can tell me that you can live in dignity on $7.25 an hour. It's time to raise the minimum wage to $15. It is long overdue and we must do it now. https://t.co/dEyBJiNh3i We need a government that stands up for working people. That is what we promised to deliver and that is what we must do. https://t.co/OIUdhOypQe When Republicans had control, they pushed through nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations. We have the majority now, and we are going to use it to pass real relief for the working people of this country. https://t.co/oEhFMQSdIs Now is not the time to think small. It is the time to think big, and address the terrible pain and suffering Americans are experiencing right now. https://t.co/hBxTXHrkNe The Republican Party has a fundamental decision to make. Will it be a conservative party functioning within a democratic society? Or will it be an authoritarian party built upon the Big Lie, conspiracy theories and violence? It cannot be both.

The time is NOW to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. https://t.co/WZWnKFBiKy The issue isn't ""bipartisanship or not."" The issue is addressing the unprecedented crises we face right now. https://t.co/Lb0AbSIZan The economic and health crises facing working families today are unprecedented. The Democratic majority must go forward this week with a comprehensive $1.9 trillion emergency COVID bill. If the GOP could use reconciliation to benefit the rich, we can use it to benefit workers. Senate Democrats are prepared to move forward with a budget resolution. We will not wait for Republicans who always support trillions in tax cuts for the wealthy, but can‚Äôt find a nickel for working class families living in great desperation. https://t.co/3Gf46PLXLl Oh look, another billionaire is mad that he might have to pay more taxes while children in America go hungry and veterans sleep on the street. Cry me a river. Yes. We will make Wall Street billionaires pay their fair share of taxes and create an economy that works for all of us. https://t.co/61lHgQO0Jr We will never get 60 votes in the Senate to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. If we are going to keep faith with millions of low wage workers, the minimum wage increase must be a part of budget reconciliation. Let us end starvation wages in America."

Read here: https://t.co/rZo4dFEszM Full statement on G-7 trade talks: https://t.co/g4aPiNVuYB #OnThisDay more than 70 years ago, Allied troops stormed the shores of France during World War II. Today, we honor the 160,000 troops who fought their way onto the beaches and we tell the story of one Nebraskan whose work made it possible. #DDay https://t.co/izniPgV3ak About those new tariffs: Europe, Canada &amp; Mexico aren't China. You don‚Äôt treat allies the same way you treat opponents. Blanket protectionism is a big part of why we had a Great Depression. ""Make America Great Again"" shouldn‚Äôt mean ""Make America 1929 Again."" Today, we remember the story of a special Nebraskan monument to our fallen heroes. May this Sea of Red be a tribute to your courage &amp; service forever. Happy #MemorialDay, and Go Big Red. #gbr https://t.co/kUS4jI1DgT Kim Jong Un is a murderous despot and habitual liar. The President made the right call to cancel this summit. If North Korea wants diplomacy, it should know that half-measures and spin about its nuclear program won‚Äôt cut it. Barbara Bush lived an extraordinary life of devotion, love, and laughter. She was a blessing to the First Family and the nation. Melissa and I lift up the entire Bush family in our prayers during this time. It is good news that today the President directed Larry Kudlow and Ambassador Lighthizer to negotiate U.S. entry into TPP: https://t.co/sfzI3eyDOM https://t.co/B75Bsdsm3x Thank you, @NDSS, for bringing the voices of Macy, Clay, and Alijah to Capitol Hill. These kids have a lot to teach us. #BWW2018 https://t.co/ls4RaU0gx5 Facebook is a really big and powerful platform. Their decisions on how to police speech will have far-reaching consequences. That‚Äôs why I asked Mark Zuckerberg in today's hearing to define ‚Äúhate speech.‚Äù

It is a hard question and an important conversation. https://t.co/YbIXbeReq6 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. persevered, even unto death, in asserting the god-given rights of all Americans.

Read the full text of his final speech, here - it will give you chills: https://t.co/JdDshdEvrc
 
May we never lose sight of his message. #MLK50 https://t.co/46jQBD8h26 He single-handedly saved millions from starvation, but most people haven‚Äôt heard of him. Today we honor Norman Borlaug, the ag pioneer who was born #OnThisDay in 1914. https://t.co/Ak098MErhg Lots of folks in politics &amp; the media are misconstruing trade. When we talk about trade, we should remember these six big ideas. https://t.co/0Q4HxqKzPt Total dysfunction. DC is about to add 1.3 TRILLION $ to your debt like it‚Äôs no big deal - and meanwhile both of our crazy uncles are fistfighting in the backyard. Happy Thanksgiving, America. https://t.co/qFfqdtJKkE Thinking of these four kids, and so many others, on World Down Syndrome Awareness Day: https://t.co/VGqsYrWivj

Dignity matters. Love matters. To Lucas, Kyle, James, Grant ‚Äì and to us all. #WDSD18 https://t.co/aG6xiOAeVy Full text of the letter @SenJohnMcCain and I sent seeking a coordinated NATO response to Russia. https://t.co/K0DCtwM2ZP https://t.co/LOL7gkjQGX Let‚Äôs get this straight: Equifax put millions of Americans at risk, got a no-bid contract from the feds, and at least one employee turned a personal profit from trading on the misfortune of the victims? 

Someone needs to answer for this. 

https://t.co/Rz3vsJF9Qa Here's how steel tariffs will actually kill steel jobs. https://t.co/NzKSGpc2Ek Op-ed with @NEFarmBureau: We need to drop the talk of unnecessary and painful trade wars and work to protect NAFTA. Nebraskans have won with NAFTA and scrapping the agreement would be a disastrously bad idea.‚Äã  https://t.co/dIdBlOTkjC We‚Äôve tried tariffs like these a bunch of times over the last two centuries. Every time, American families have suffered. This trade policy will be disastrous. https://t.co/x1KeV9d2y9 Trade is great for America. It's great for American families. Trade creates jobs &amp; lowers prices for American families. 

Trade wars do the opposite. No trade war has ever worked. We don't want to make America 1930 again. https://t.co/fK7oy7GcVz #OnThisDay 151 years ago, Nebraska officially became a state. Today we celebrate the pioneers, caretakers of the land, statesmen, and volunteers who have made our state so great. https://t.co/LsjdesXjRa #OnThisDay in 1980, we beat the USSR in a hockey match that is still one of sports history‚Äôs greatest upsets: the Miracle on Ice. https://t.co/ULRH4S5DtV Sports don‚Äôt just build character; they reveal it. Kudos to Rachel Mulligan, whose cross country skiing earned medals in the 500m freestyle race &amp; 1km freestyle race in the @SpecialOlympics Winter World Games in Austria. Thanks for making Nebraska proud! @SONebraska #SOHillDay https://t.co/cyVdmnRyp2 Today we remember the ""Buffalo Soldiers"" who served at Nebraska‚Äôs Ft Robinson nearly 100 years before the Civil Rights Act. These volunteers suffered indignities from their colleagues, commanding officers, and even from the very citizens they worked to protect. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/bS3s76rUw6 Honored to have @NEStatePatrol‚Äôs John Lewis as my #SOTU guest tonight. This hero went above &amp; beyond to serve his neighbor after hurricanes ravaged the Florida Keys. America needs more neighbors like him. https://t.co/nYV9qHWHK7 Tomorrow, hundreds of thousands will travel to Washington, D.C. from across the country to #MarchForLife. The crowd will fill city blocks. But the real movement is even bigger. #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/wCkAMIWoHf The #NEBreakfast is back. Check out the 2018 dates and learn more about this 75-year-old tradition here: https://t.co/iZi9NNF1Uy https://t.co/2phIRUD12w #OnThisDay in 1888, a blizzard tore through the Great Plains, killing about 300 people, many of them children. But the real story wasn‚Äôt the great power of the storm, it was the great stories of resilience and heroism - especially of the schoolteachers. https://t.co/4UXYjy2VQO This is national security 101: Washington should be hunting down terrorists who fund global violence with domestic drug money. https://t.co/XGUMbrWGIK It‚Äôs not helpful to call the press the enemy of the American people. Here‚Äôs why. #1a https://t.co/dhiVY5ndqZ What this terrifying statistic tells us: we are failing to teach the First Amendment to the next generation. https://t.co/TBHz8WIf6Q Merry Christmas! Today we remember a Christmas miracle that happened #OnThisDay in North Platte in 1941. https://t.co/AevghkcYms The First Amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment, and you don‚Äôt get to separate the five freedoms that are in there. https://t.co/Y6OTkHOk2v #OnThisDay in 1891, a group of boys at a YMCA played the first-ever game of basketball. But the story is bigger than the sport - it's about inventor James Naismith &amp; his heart for service. What he teaches us: https://t.co/axOqfvJ6if #OnThisDay in 1777, Washington led his army into a winter encampment at Valley Forge. Why we should remember their bleak Christmas today: https://t.co/VdCRiaFgU4 CONFIRMED. The end of a long process in the Senate is just the beginning of a new chapter in Steve Grasz‚Äôs distinguished record of public service for Nebraska &amp; the nation. https://t.co/lyLino6A4G 

https://t.co/8grn7v4A7a https://t.co/U78lv7qK9f https://t.co/I45M15Yq4y #OnThisDay in 1775, we had a plan to turn stolen British guns back on the redcoats &amp; break the Siege of Boston. The only problem? They were 300 miles away, at Fort Ticonderoga. Watch the incredible story: https://t.co/a1kwLVKeE6 Today we give thanks that our country was based on the premise of religious liberty. Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/x3aEaFDWvR #OnThisDay in 1863, President Lincoln spoke timeless truths on a Civil War battlefield to unite a tired &amp; divided nation around our founding beliefs. Why we need to re-read the Gettysburg Address today: https://t.co/XxfDB23X4d https://t.co/JYXzlVbknM ‚ÄúThe Day of Two Noons‚Äù happened #OnThisDay in 1883 ‚Äì and it‚Äôs an incredible lesson in how businesses can drive national innovation. https://t.co/kfLptWUYzq The ABA isn't a neutral vetter of judges but a liberal organization that has publicly &amp; consistently advocated for left-of-center positions. https://t.co/ZTMrJVEAjw One way our office can serve veterans: helping them receive the service medals they have earned. Colin‚Äôs story: https://t.co/o2JhIzEKsR https://t.co/izxHB1iib5 We owe our veterans an enduring debt of gratitude, today and every day. #VeteransDay https://t.co/UXfHtKc2ds Their stories help us understand the cost of freedom. Meet the #veterans of the NE Wounded Warriors Writing Workshop: https://t.co/neYi3A2c0a #VeteransDay https://t.co/kYDEDA8D2J Whether it‚Äôs helping our neighbors after a natural disaster or defending American interests, Nebraskans know that we can depend on the men &amp; women of @NENationalGuard to be there for us in our times of need. Thank you for your service. https://t.co/Yx7dGfWLED The ABA purports to be a neutral arbiter, but is frankly twisting its ratings process to drive a political agenda. Here's how: https://t.co/kyQgSNHOOT #OnThisDay 53 years ago, Reagan gave his famous ‚ÄúA Time for Choosing‚Äù speech. It still has much to say to us today. https://t.co/4DaIpLUfUO Now that we‚Äôve got your attention with Dr Pepper, let‚Äôs not forget the real substance from today‚Äôs hearing. https://t.co/rvSmohvnnh Nebraskans have no patience for improper treatment of our veterans, nor for attempts to cover it up. https://t.co/Zkt8ZjtqqC We celebrate the fall of ISIS in Raqqa &amp; the liberation of the oppressed, but this is no time to let off of the gas. https://t.co/REBjJcXVWf https://t.co/5Xl7lAA5bF Russia is a clear adversary in cyberspace and we can‚Äôt afford these self-inflicted injuries. https://t.co/tKA0uQyeig https://t.co/82VCTw9vmu So, post-hack, Equifax gets $$$ in a no-bid IRS contract &amp; potentially profits selling ID protection to hack victims? We deserve answers. https://t.co/IjIvyM4hIk The Gilmores didn‚Äôt plan to adopt. But when the opportunity found them, they jumped in: https://t.co/pV5A80JWCP #AdoptionAngels https://t.co/0gPm1dbaNT We are an economic &amp; military superpower &amp; trade is an effective weapon.

Happy #ConstitutionDay! https://t.co/ElVrmuv9EL #NeverForget https://t.co/icW1AZTSRd We should fund emergency hurricane relief. We shouldn't spend other $ pretending it's emergency hurricane relief. https://t.co/N7D022fHct https://t.co/a3btdSfKwq The Pelosi-Schumer-Trump deal is bad. What makes Husker football great? The same things that make Nebraska great. #GameDay #GBR #Huskers https://t.co/NaqBKEtZrZ https://t.co/2CbLJy0x7e We need to have a ‚Äúone cheer for politics‚Äù view of the world. Here‚Äôs what I mean by that: https://t.co/3m41YlisqR Why the #MarchOnWashington, held #OnThisDay in 1963, remains one of the greatest triumphs of the First Amendment: https://t.co/Qf8UYFAGFt https://t.co/l5m6a2D64v #OnThisDay in 1814 the British torched DC‚Äîbut 2 patriots saved vital American artifacts from destruction. The story: https://t.co/Ye2s2zdQMU https://t.co/JADt3fWdKP Eclipses are time capsules. Yesterday's #SolarEclipse2017 highlighted the incredible economic disruption &amp; innovation of the last century. https://t.co/FRdKk6s2Bu As thousands gather @HomesteadNM &amp; across Nebraska to watch tomorrow‚Äôs historic eclipse, a quick reminder to keep those bright eyes safe: https://t.co/nRbvewBQNu #OnThisDay in 1889, Americans raised $100,000 for the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. Here's what that great story says about America: https://t.co/qsS29kpeEq A word of humble advice to our President: if you‚Äôre thinking of making a recess appointment to push out the Atty General, forget about it. https://t.co/7P896qJJzX We still have a long, long way to go ‚Äì both in health policy and in honesty.

Saddle up: https://t.co/cTht5udI1E https://t.co/FHWc0k7w1t These heroes deserve our thanks. Honored to be a small part in sending the #HonorFlight off at 3AM. https://t.co/XuroVkvW00 Nebraskans don't take the land for granted. It's why we started #ArborDay. https://t.co/HJYF6G444N In American politics, is it a radical idea to say that the state exists to preserve freedom? So what is so radical about @FedSoc? https://t.co/1WtrJiVhXc If we view Russian interference through partisan lenses, they have already begun to win. Here's why: https://t.co/c95cJLwiwR The moment we face today is a lot like the urbanization moment of the 1890s. Can America persist in an age when we don‚Äôt know our neighbors? https://t.co/aCEJR6WirR Free trade benefits the whole world ‚Äì but it *really* benefits Nebraska. https://t.co/H28r1XgBD3 Decentralization of government is a good thing. Here‚Äôs why a president ‚Äì from either party ‚Äì having lots of power is a bad thing: https://t.co/62Ay3xa0KZ Consumers win when there is more trade. Producers win when there is more trade. We should not scapegoat trade. https://t.co/Zb4qYdQW5w Thanks to the @LiedLodge for hosting today's Stronger Economies Together (SET) 2017 Southeast Nebraska Manufacturers Summit. https://t.co/oqsuwSRwsU Good news for the rule of law: Today, Judge Gorsuch takes his black robe to #SCOTUS. #Confirmed https://t.co/MXDqk58mYC https://t.co/dxvubfNyHG Highlight of the week: meeting with Macy, Nebraska‚Äôs finest legislative advocate.

Watch below, then read this: https://t.co/XxYvjJ39qK https://t.co/WPLq261Qvb Overturning this rule is a win for kids, because Washington‚Äôs good intentions can‚Äôt excuse garbage rules. https://t.co/TgaT7WWdnf https://t.co/DNYnE79ktV Today we honor one of the most important men you‚Äôve probably never heard of: Norman Borlaug, the ag pioneer who was born #OnThisDay in 1914. https://t.co/ac69QO90Ga Neil Gorsuch is a threat to you ‚Äúif you breathe air or drink water‚Äù? There is a real danger in not condemning that kind of reckless speech. https://t.co/2a7oKgJ4u3 Won bigly at #GorsuchHearing. https://t.co/rWF6JgFED4 Asked Judge Gorsuch for quick overview of why we have the Bill of Rights. It‚Äôs worth watching his answer. #GorsuchHearing https://t.co/o94Izap5WY Seeking assurances from judges on future rulings is like asking a referee for pledges to a certain outcome before the tip-off. #SCOTUS https://t.co/PWVn6kJe4r In Neil Gorsuch, we have a qualified judge who knows what a judge's job is ‚Äî he should be confirmed 100-0. #ConfirmGorsuch https://t.co/Hxt5TyPTry Focused my remarks around a simple image: a judge‚Äôs black robe. Here's why Judge Gorsuch will faithfully embody the spirit of that robe: https://t.co/HqzCumUuSU Judge Gorsuch knows what a judge's job is. Folks across the political spectrum should be excited about him when they read his opinions. https://t.co/lHrsJKKFfx Concerned about overreaching executives? About the lack of accountability in the administrative bureaucracies of the gov't? #ConfirmGorsuch. https://t.co/josQniReyk Nebraskans don't take the land for granted.

Nebraska‚Äôs farmers &amp; ranchers won‚Äôt shed a single tear. https://t.co/urfVyVq1Q8 https://t.co/x3qDAJ9NAS It was a great privilege to deliver this address. May we study together these virtues of self-government again. https://t.co/gWtDux4Qbv Around 17% of Nebraskan corn is exported to Mexico. Exports are very important for Nebraska agriculture. https://t.co/O44qYgUkkY https://t.co/TgCvJHNoic Nebraska farmers cannot become collateral damage in a trade war.  https://t.co/ZjBCWVFEv2 Putin and his thugs are fundamentally at odds with America‚Äôs interests. https://t.co/SqozmACrbg It's our constitutional duty to conduct honest congressional oversight that restores public trust in self-government https://t.co/B0utCny1sm This should not be viewed through partisan labels. Congress should investigate Russia‚Äôs influence campaign in the US https://t.co/B0utCny1sm This is bigger than D vs. R. The Founders' intended the check on consolidation of power to come from the other branches of government. https://t.co/QRT1USODvd Here's why everyone across the political spectrum should applaud the pick of Judge Gorsuch for #SCOTUS. https://t.co/3E1Qwiqftw The #CFPB's mission to prohibit ‚Äúabusive practices‚Äù sounds great. But all that power has little accountability. https://t.co/bxgJhILUoC Met w/Gorsuch today. To the Chicken Littles on the other side of the aisle: he's a supremely qualified nominee.‚Äã https://t.co/CMpVTMNVWX https://t.co/37iKyC57L9 Judge Gorsuch is a rockstar.

He's not trying to be a superlegislator. https://t.co/cAU0oghAGe Great to intro @USDA nominee Perdue to some of the Nebraskans whose hard work makes us the world‚Äôs breadbasket. @NEFarmBureau @NECattlemen https://t.co/5M2BnbxbDs Judge Gorsuch is exactly the kind of person who should be on the Supreme Court. Here's why. #SCOTUS https://t.co/xlKjrjwNzT Reintroduced Sarah's Law in the new Congress.

A study showed voters in predominantly black neighborhoods waited 29 percent longer, on average, than those in white neighborhoods. They were also about 74 percent more likely to wait for more than half an hour.¬†So GA Republicans responded by making it illegal to give them water. I‚Äôm not a lawyer, and please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but it seems to me that an elected member of the State House knocking on the door of governors office is not illegal. https://t.co/TbNU7Xsso0 There was a coup attempt, on the basis of a lie, and now that lie is being used to, among other things, make it illegal to give some water to a voter waiting in line. This is not unrelated to January 6. This is the predictable next step. The Republican Party has several elected officials whom I respect. And there are many voters who we democrats should listen to carefully, understand, and try to win over. But the driving force behind Trump‚Äôs party is retrograde antidemocratic authoritarianism. Why did you use something called the geoSPatial Operating Console, or SPOC, to monitor, among other things, ‚ÄúWhole Foods Market Activism/Unionization Efforts,‚Äù and ‚Äúunion grant money flow patterns?‚Äù https://t.co/xeYcxwJ8sj HEY CHECK THIS OUT https://t.co/11fxIbun4m I‚Äôm for statehood because the status quo results in American citizens having no one represent them in Congress.

I disagree with you. https://t.co/WyI5I05hGM I was gonna do a media criticism tweet but instead I will just say that our bill cuts child poverty in half and is the largest investment in native communities in American history and is causing economists to revise upward their growth protections. This is could very well be a title 9 violation not by an individual school but by the whole NCAA.

"Schumer, Chuck",SenSchumer,chuckschumer,New York,New York,Senator," At a time when so many in our country are calling for action against civil injustices and racial violence, Vanita Gupta is exactly who we need at the Department of Justice.

We are moving forward to #ConfirmGupta to serve as the next Associate Attorney General. Adam Toledo was just 13 years old. He was a child. This is heartbreaking.

He deserves justice. His family deserves justice. America needs the #ForThePeople Act

It'll combat voter suppression efforts by GOP state legislatures

It'll limit dark money from big special interests empowered by Citizens United

It'll root out corruption in Washington

The #ForThePeople Act is a priority of this Congress There is a concerted, cynical, un-American, and racist effort by Republican-led state legislatures to limit the right of American citizens to vote.

The #ForThePeople Act is a priority of this Congress to fight this voter suppression and renew democracy. Vanita Gupta is the first civil rights attorney and first woman of color to be nominated for Associate Attorney General.

Her exemplary track record of championing criminal justice reform shows why we need her in this position right now.

We are working to #ConfirmGupta The Senate will deliver a powerful message to Asian Americans that their voices are heard, their concerns are felt, and that their government will take swift, decisive action to protect them.

We're moving forward with @MazieHirono &amp; @RepGraceMeng's bill to #StopAsianHate. 74 years ago today, Jackie Robinson broke baseball‚Äôs ‚Äúcolor barrier‚Äù when he started at first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

I‚Äôve worked for her nomination from the beginning.

She will ensure environmental justice is at the center of building a clean energy future that creates jobs and growing our economy. Student debt is holding back millions from being able to build the financial resources needed to rent apartments, buy homes, build their futures.
 
President Biden can #CancelStudentDebt and provide much-needed relief to struggling people and families.

I'll work with @POTUS to pass a big, bold bill that will drive America forward for decades to come American families, especially low-income families, must have access to safe and clean drinking water.

This week, the Senate will vote on @MazieHirono's and @RepGraceMeng's COVID Hate Crimes Bill to #StopAsianHate. Daunte Wright should be alive.

I worked hand-in-hand with arts unions to deliver real relief for our arts workers in the #AmericanRescuePlan. Today would be a great day for President Biden and Vice President Harris to #CancelStudentDebt. The NY legislature is voting on the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act to legalize marijuana today

Abuse, prejudice, violence against Asian Americans is on the rise

We can't lose our vigilance against the forces of hate, bigotry, discrimination

That‚Äôs why I set up a vote on the COVID Hate Crimes Bill to help #StopAsianHate We saw it in Georgia last night. We see it across the country.

A concerted, nationwide, and racist effort by Republican state legislatures to limit the right of American citizens to vote.

The #ForThePeople Act is a priority of this Congress to fight this and renew Democracy. https://t.co/E0TFJ68dqv Last night, the Senate did three good things:

‚ÄîPrevented a 2% cut to Medicare

‚ÄîExtended PPP for small businesses

‚ÄîSet up a vote on the COVID Hate Crimes Bill to help #StopAsianHate

And there's so much more to do on voting rights, economy and climate, and gun safety. Since 2012‚Äîthe GA GOP has closed more than 200 polling places.

Voters in mostly Black precincts now wait 8X LONGER to vote than voters in mostly white precincts.

Now the GOP makes it a crime to give water to people standing in long lines THEY CREATED.

Despicable!

We will act. https://t.co/K7tyfmkHfM Today would be a great day for President Biden and Vice President Harris to #CancelStudentDebt. Today is the 110th anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire in which 146 workers died.

It will have an immense impact.

Here‚Äôs what it means for you. https://t.co/S9kjQLF6my This Senate will act to address the epidemic of gun violence in this country.

I will put a bill to help stop gun violence on the floor of the Senate. Across the country, the Republicans seem to believe that the best strategy for winning elections is to try to prevent the other side from voting.

That‚Äôs not democracy. 

The Senate will pass the #ForThePeople Act to fight this voter suppression and protect democracy for all. Last week, the Judiciary Committee held the first hearing on the #EqualityAct

This landmark legislation would enshrine as law that no American shall be denied justice based on their gender or sexual orientation

We're working to pass it, because LGBTQ+ rights are human rights This Senate passed the #AmericanRescuePlan to fight the COVID health and economic crisis.

And this Senate will take action on 

Civil rights and voting rights

Economic recovery, jobs, and the climate crisis

Health and gun safety BREAKING: The Senate just passed an extension of the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program to make sure small businesses will be able to continue to access this critical relief to weather the COVID crisis. The #AmericanRescuePlan delivers:

A significant reduction in child poverty

The single largest investment in K-12 education and Native communities‚Äîever

Significant help for Black farmers

A lifeline to small businesses

Historic levels of housing assistance

And more Today, I announced the Senate will vote on @MazieHirono's and @RepGraceMeng's COVID Hate Crimes Bill.

It will give the Justice Department‚Äîand local communities‚Äîcrucial tools to fight the wave of racist violence we‚Äôve seen against Asian Americans.

We will act to #StopAsianHate."

https://t.co/hnI9tQdXmH On #GoldStarSpousesDay, we honor the strength and sacrifice of the family members of the strong men and women who have given their lives in service of our beloved country. We owe them endless gratitudeüôèüèø Thank you to @SCChamber, @UWASC, @AtriumHealth, @BankofAmerica, @HomegrownHG, Lowcountry Hotels, and @NephronPharm for helping us with this new initiative.

Read my game plan to help folks like me here: 
https://t.co/aDxgWLOFzf I grew up poor and nearly flunked out of my Title I high school. 

It is my mission to provide opportunities for kids growing up as I did. 

Opportunity Internships will open new doors and help students realize their full potential. 

https://t.co/csyEHmYMPx This Easter marked the 53rd anniversary of the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It‚Äôs hard to put into words his impact on my life &amp; the lives of millions across the world. We must continue his legacy of love, unity, peace, &amp; pursuit of brighter days.
https://t.co/zJa4f1YnbV Did you know that less than 6% of the Biden ""infrastructure plan"" actually goes to repairing our roads and bridges? 

The other 94% is just another progressive, job-killing payment plan for the Green New Deal and the Left‚Äôs remake of America.

https://t.co/TlDo2PcNQ0 Our hearts are filled with gratitude as we celebrate the life of Jesus Christ, the risen king! Happy Easter! https://t.co/AiClIJuYk6 ü§ôüèøIt‚Äôs Game Day! I‚Äôm excited to cheer on @GamecockWBB to victory tonight in the #WFinalFour¬†#ForeverToThee On this Good Friday, I am thankful for the brave @CapitolPolice officers whose selfless actions keep us safe every day. 

It‚Äôs been a hard year for these men and women. Please join me in praying for them and their loved ones.

https://t.co/Ou7UXwPlXB I‚Äôm heartbroken over the passing of the Capitol police officer who lost their life fighting to keep us safe. We owe these strong men and women so much for their sacrifice. My prayers are with the entire force and their loved ones. All my staff and interns in my DC office are safe and accounted for. My prayers are with the Capitol Police officers and first responders involved in today‚Äôs events at the Capitol. It's our job to work toward bipartisanship, not around it. Changing long-standing rules to push through a radical agenda is not just wrong‚Äîit is a naked power grab that would destroy the Senate. 
https://t.co/YwflklavHl Today is an incredible reminder that even in the darkest times, hope and love live on. I am praying you all have a blessed #GoodFriday! https://t.co/SYxn3dbtB2 I had a great time speaking with Latosha Jenkins and her son Braylon at @MtgStAcademy about the importance of #schoolchoice.
 
Every family should have the power to choose the school that best fits their child's needs. #TwoWithTim https://t.co/cffcUcn8Lg The crisis at the border is heartbreaking. Children‚Äôs lives are put in danger every day by smugglers who are getting rich off of the Biden administration‚Äôs weak policies.

We must call it what it is: a border crisis, a health crisis, a humanitarian crisis.
https://t.co/RpFciEwFeA The Biden ""infrastructure plan"" is not about improving America‚Äôs infrastructure. It's yet another Trojan horse for the far Left‚Äôs agenda.

Crushing tax hikes &amp; killing jobs is the last thing our country can afford right now. 

Enough with the partisan games. Let‚Äôs work together. Whether taking online classes, starting a business, or job searching, broadband access is crucial for anyone working towards their dreams. Thank you @UofSC and @BenedictEDU for helping South Carolinians reach their full potential!
¬†
https://t.co/BdNOAn2B1l Americans elected a 50-50 Senate to work together‚Äînot to enact radical policy changes that would permanently alter our nation. But without the filibuster, there is no path to consensus or compromise. South Carolina's @TheTandD gets it right: https://t.co/ANtxIznB0i The assassination attempt on President Reagan rocked our nation and the world. As a fellow conservative, I‚Äôm thankful for his resiliency in the face of danger, selfless service, and love of country. https://t.co/441ErQVpV3 On this #NationalDoctorsDay, join me in saying thank you to our nation's medical professionals who have been our heroes on the front lines of this pandemic.
 
You showed up‚Äîno matter the personal risk‚Äîto be the difference in the lives of so many! Access to the internet is essential for families &amp; businesses across SC, yet more than 650,000 people lack adequate access in our state alone. @LindseyGrahamSC &amp; I are working to close that gap &amp; ensure all Americans have the tools they need to reach their full potential. https://t.co/2GmlfRLIpv Increased broadband access means more opportunity for underserved &amp; rural communities all throughout South Carolina and the nation. I‚Äôm proud to reintroduce the State Fix Act with my friend @LindseyGrahamSC to connect every American to success. https://t.co/EwRGiD0GXB Today we salute the 2.7 million Americans who served in the Vietnam War. Welcome home‚Äîwe are grateful for your service and sacrifice. #VietnamWarVeteransDay https://t.co/rfNqMHAi3Q My thoughts and prayers are with my good friend Thom, his wife Susan, and the whole Tillis Family.

Wishing you all a blessed and peaceful #Passover! https://t.co/7Y0WrhlhSw To finish out the series, we honor the great Mary McLeod Bethune with help from Diane Sumpter.

Mary was a leading educator, a civil rights leader, and an advisor to five presidents.

Her school, @bethunecookman, still serves thousands of students today. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/iRgN18XGQ4 We honor the wonderful Anita Zucker with help from Lou Kennedy.

Anita is the chairperson and CEO of The InterTech Group and has made it a life goal to equip youth for success. 

She generously contributes millions to educational causes across South Carolina! #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/GTkq6QFV2t Will the real Chuck Schumer please stand up? https://t.co/k6ipFj1rer It is clear the gravity of the crisis at our border is harrowing.

By undoing the strong policies of the Trump administration, Democrats created a humanitarian &amp; national security crisis. @POTUS must take action before more damage is done. https://t.co/TLmvLqR05j The Democrats‚Äô strategy to abolish to filibuster has less to do with solving problems of our racial past and more to do with solving the problem of who will hold power in the future. My thoughts on the filibuster and more: https://t.co/1Q9CIWoerF President Obama &amp; President Biden both vigorously defended the filibuster in 2005. The reason for Democrats‚Äô change of heart is painfully transparent: Silencing the voice of the minority is the only way they can pass their radical agenda. https://t.co/HimYXfft3Z More great news! Starting March 31, ALL South Carolinians aged 16+ will be eligible for the vaccine!
 
Thank you to all those who have worked tirelessly to get us here. Together, we are getting closer each day to defeating COVID-19. #SCstrong https://t.co/PVRFOalo1z Thank you, Lisa Van Riper, for helping us recognize the trailblazing Sarah Campbell Allan, the first licensed female doctor in the state. 

She served patients and taught the next generation of doctors in Columbia for years. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/qu0h0nKTWy We honor the brilliant Darla Moore with help from Jodie W. McLean.

Not only is she a prominent investor, entrepreneur, &amp; philanthropist, she‚Äôs a woman with a huge heart who has donated millions of dollars to charity. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/gm1NPk10jT Thanks to my friend, Anita Zucker, for honoring the trailblazing Eliza Lucas Pinckney. She is credited with building SC‚Äôs indigo industry, one of the state's largest exports during the 1700s. She's also the 1st woman inducted into the SC Business Hall of Fame. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/SxNSDEB1hp Today, we recognize the amazing Anna DeCosta Banks with help from Dr. Linda Bell. 

Anna was the first head nurse at Charleston‚Äôs Hospital and Training School. 

She spent her life fighting to advance health care in the Lowcountry. 
#WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/ipKTrv9eRU Today, we honor distinguished military heroes like SC‚Äôs Sgt. Major Thomas Payne.

Thomas received the Medal of Honor a few months ago for saving hostages in Iraq captured by ISIS.

We can‚Äôt thank him enough for his bravery and sacrifice. #MedalOfHonorDay 

https://t.co/sVaIAc9lVa We must call out woke supremacy for what it is ‚Äîthe attacking and silencing of individuals with differing opinions.

We have a choice: woke mandates and virtue signaling or the Opportunity Society.

Listen to my full @RuthlessPodcast interview here:
https://t.co/bzKPfupux1 The Democrats‚Äô assault on the filibuster is wrong.

It's the perfect example of the ‚Äúwoke Left‚Äù shutting down any debate to push through their radical agenda.

A system too fragile to entertain divergent points of view is doomed to fail. Thanks for having me, guys!

Be sure to tune in tomorrow morning. As the minions say, it‚Äôs gonna beüî• https://t.co/5fW7IxMlQH Thanks to Addison Propes, granddaughter of my friend Mary Propes, for helping me acknowledge the passionate Lisa Van Riper.
 
She's a strong pro-life advocate who has worked with the SC General Assembly to pass bills protecting women and their unborn children. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/QsohaE6ALA For today‚Äôs #WomensHistoryMonth highlight, we honor the renowned @TheVannaWhite with help from Rep.@ShannonErickson1.

This is a crisis of the Dems' making.
https://t.co/qDG7rpFATu Today, we take a moment to recognize the incredible @NikkiHaley with help from Leyla Gulen. 

From representing Lexington in the State House, to the governor‚Äôs mansion, &amp; all the way to the @UN, she is a barrier breaker &amp; role model for all women &amp; girls! #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/qF872eBMp3 I‚Äôm celebrating #WomensHistoryMonth by honoring inspiring SC women who have made a huge impact on our state and nation.

My heart goes out to you, Kirstin, and to the family members of every person killed in Boulder yesterday. 

South Carolinians know all too well the pain &amp; suffering in the wake of a tragic shooting. Our prayers are with all of Colorado. https://t.co/ZrUCjag1Dg Woke supremacy is the ‚Äútolerant‚Äù left‚Äôs intolerance for dissent. It is a progressive conception of diversity that does not include diversity of thought. It is discrimination falsely marketed as inclusion.

Read my full thoughts here:  https://t.co/4AUiQPZYNt Democrats are trying to change the rules to nationalize our elections, making them less secure and less reliable.

‚ùå Implementing ballot harvesting

I‚Äôm also blessed to have your old office...it‚Äôs great!

Your life is an example that we should all emulate. I‚Äôm praying you have many more birthdays. This #WomensHistoryMonth, I‚Äôm honoring South Carolina women who have greatly impacted me, our state, and the world.

I, of course, had to kick off this series by sharing the story of the strongest woman I know: my mama. https://t.co/kITj73wq3N I‚Äôm glad I was able to visit Tommy‚Äôs Ham House one more time before it closes.

Tommy has served generations of South Carolinians, tourists, &amp; political candidates southern cuisine &amp; top-notch hospitality. His service &amp; food will be missed!

https://t.co/x5G3g6nNfD The guidance keeps changing, but we‚Äôve known for months that it‚Äôs safe for students to return to the classroom.

#OpenSchoolsNow

https://t.co/Wc3sPm9wlI Great to meet with plant managers from South Carolina who are getting their roughly 1,000 employees vaccinated and back to work. 

I hope to see them back in the state real soon! https://t.co/bKgbj3OLbU The rise in Asian American discrimination is not only un-American, but it‚Äôs morally and ethically reprehensible. Our nation stands against hate in ANY and ALL forms. Racism has no place in our society and it's our duty as Americans to speak out‚Äîloudly‚Äîwhen we see it. As Ranking Member of the Senate Aging Committee, I will champion everyday issues like financial security &amp; health care for our older population, who have given their all to make our nation strong.

I want to thank the @SCSBDC for supporting small business owners and workers in South Carolina, especially over this last year!

#NationalSBDCDAY Always enjoy speaking to folks back home!
 
The Dem ""COVID bill"" is really a progressive payment plan for liberal policies that are bad for SC.
 
The Left overpromises, underdelivers, &amp; leaves taxpayers with the bill.
 
My full interview with @JoeyHudson: https://t.co/jdXiYKdj50 Great time meeting with our state interns! 

They had insightful questions on legislation, conservative values, and more. 

I‚Äôm so thankful for their service to the great people of South Carolina, and I wish them well in all of their future endeavors! https://t.co/i3OtFk6Lfc The Expanding Access to Lending Options Act provides important regulatory flexibility to allow credit unions to offer a wider choice of products and services to more effectively meet the credit needs of their members and communities. Credit unions are a key part of the economic ecosystem, and the services they provide make a positive and personalized difference in the financial lives of millions of Americans. 
https://t.co/zyEK6LiZX7 Having been an independent contractor for 7 years, I understand why 9/10 independent workers prefer their status. 

Nationalizing California's ABC test would destroy the gig economy.

Secretary Su's position is anathema to the future of our nation's small businesses. https://t.co/kreycpilAM Many thanks to Governor @HenryMcMaster for his Conservative leadership. SC knows how our money should be used better than any federal bureaucrat in Washington. The State Fiscal Flexibility Act will ensure that our state leaders are able to continue making the best economic decisions for South Carolinians and not at the mercy of liberal politicians. Democrats slipped in language in their progressive payment plan that not only infringes upon the rights of states, but also penalizes states that have remained financially responsible throughout the pandemic. 
https://t.co/rgbjJithtB At a time when our nation is struggling economically, Democrats are forcing the American people to foot the bill for billions of dollars in special interests that have nothing to do with the pandemic.
 
It's shameful, and our country deserves better.
 
https://t.co/0aBBnKg0HL South Carolina is making great strides in defeating #COVID19. 

We have more work ahead, and we will continue to make progress 
as more people get vaccinated. 

Find out if you‚Äôre eligible and make your appointment today: https://t.co/hnI9tQdXmH https://t.co/19gXd64Hkh Great to see South Carolinians give back during these tough times!

https://t.co/rmTB0PciH8 If President Biden truly wants unity, he should give credit where it's due. The Trump Administration delivered:
‚úÖVaccine development within 1 year
‚úÖ1 million doses distributed each day by January 20th
‚úÖFive bipartisan COVID relief bills
 
Full interview:https://t.co/KPmPlaOAfa Despite promises of unity and bipartisanship, President Biden's policy positions have created chasms between Americans on the Left and Right. We have to focus our attention on what's best for the nation as a whole, which the Democrats' so-called ""COVID relief"" bill does not do. https://t.co/ko54QMu0Af But while there is still work to do, there is also good news on the horizon: we went to work on behalf of the American people, and I am thankful to say the seeds we sowed in 2020, like the Payment Protection Program and broadband efforts, are now coming to fruition in 2021. About a year ago, our nation and the world were devastated by #COVID19.

Thousands of Americans have lost their lives, and our nation will forever mourn that loss. 

https://t.co/9N6fWihqa1 We are not in the same place we were a year ago.

The ever-growing body of evidence shows that:
-school closures have detrimental effects on our youth
-schools do not pose a high risk of #COVID19 transmission

There's now no excuse. We must #OpenSchools! https://t.co/9Wj4HtbyCt It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve met with a school group here in DC but I just so happened to run into this senior class trip from Orangeburg today on my way to vote. My day was made seeing these South Carolinians in our nation‚Äôs capital ‚Äî Y‚Äôall stay safe! https://t.co/L8lD4wCakC For this stop on my virtual county tour, we are landing in Abbeville County! I enjoyed chatting with Penny, Jay, Stephen, and Andy about the incredible resiliency of the folks in the county - even through the pandemic. #TSCountyTour https://t.co/Y4OImjETqu At a time when religious freedoms are under assault, the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act is a necessary protection for those who are living according to their convictions. I am grateful my colleagues are standing with me to protect this most fundamental right. (2/2) In South Carolina and across the country, faith-based foster care providers support the 400,000 children in our foster care system who‚Äîthrough no fault of their own‚Äîhave nowhere else to go. (1/2) https://t.co/ikplnKRltC Sally Atwater‚Äòs legacy as an educator and dedicated advocate for conservative causes have left a lasting impact on South Carolina. 

My sincerest condolences are with her family. I spoke with a restaurant worker in Charleston who says increasing the minimum wage would reduce his income, eliminate his benefits, and force him to get a second job.
 
$15/hr. = destruction of jobs across the country
 
I won't stop fighting this disastrous mandate. #TwoWithTim https://t.co/tT2KnHjm8l Whether it's shutting schools or using tax dollars to bail out liberal states, Dems will stop at nothing to ram their radical agenda to destroy opportunity for an entire generation. 

The good news? Republicans have a better way.

My full interview here: 
https://t.co/K6ZxkNBtCb The Democrats' ""COVID relief"" package is nothing but a progressive payment plan for cities, states, and prisoners.

Y‚Äôall make South Carolina proud ü§ôüèæüèÜ https://t.co/BVyOKJJQga 56 years ago, Alabama state troopers brutally attacked Congressman John Lewis &amp; hundreds of peaceful protesters on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 

It‚Äôs the first Bloody Sunday without John, but his legacy lives on. 

We must remember &amp; honor one of the greatest champions of freedom. ... and even provides stimulus checks to people in prison today.¬†Simply put, this is not a ‚ÄòCOVID relief package,‚Äô it is a Trojan Horse for the radical Left‚Äôs progressive wish list. (4/4) To make matters worse, it creates slush funds to bail out states that mismanage their finances, has no requirements to get children back in the classroom, slows down our already recovering economy, discourages people from re-entering the workforce... (3/4) Ninety percent of this pork-filled bill is unrelated to the pandemic,¬†less than¬†ten percent of this bill is for COVID health care relief, and only one percent is designated for vaccines.

https://t.co/VALdBq70hG We have seen an increase in failing grades, developmental delays, and suicides amongst our nation‚Äôs students. 

Our children have suffered enough. 

Proud to join my friend @marcorubio in introducing this amendment to reopen our schools. https://t.co/toZrUhlmSd https://t.co/htOSCyr2bF Disappointed that all 50 @SenateDems voted against my amendment to keep states accountable for underreported #COVID19 nursing home deaths.

Americans deserve to know the truth, and our fight for those who have lost loved ones is far from over. https://t.co/kDWA3GDUt0 This shouldn't be political. 

We need to have accurate information about the deaths in nursing homes.

The more information we have, the better we can protect our seniors. https://t.co/60Se4kr9JR I'm glad to see bipartisan opposition to increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour. 

Washington needs more common sense, and this vote keeping millions of jobs intact is a good start.

#BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/sFEsmFlzVJ This is welcome news, but the fight isn‚Äôt over! 

I will continue to defend workers and small business owners in South Carolina and across the country from job-killing, out-of-touch mandates. 

A $15 minimum wage would destroy our economy... Period.

https://t.co/6aIYF7x5zK I had a great time visiting @MtgStAcademy in Charleston, where students are safely learning in-person.

Every school across the country should follow their example.
 
If they don't, we'll see more suicides, emotional instability, &amp; learning loss.
 
Reopen the schools! #TwoWithTim https://t.co/6CRwObvKQZ By giving those with health savings accounts more control over their own medical expenses, we can dramatically improve affordability and access to care for 22 million Americans.
 
Glad to work with my friend, @SenRubioPress, on this important issue. https://t.co/sxA4NmZGNF As a child who grew up working jobs under the min. wage, &amp; as a business owner that paid over the min. wage, I know this mandate will kill jobs &amp; destroy our small businesses.

Check out these highlights from last year ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/sJ855njReg It's why I introduced the Telehealth Modernization Act to increase access to telehealth.

Updating our laws to solve today‚Äôs challenges through commonsense and practical approaches will ensure more access to health care and a safer aging population. 

https://t.co/Z5YTpqrP9f As Ranking Member on the Senate Aging Committee, I know how important telehealth is to our nation‚Äôs seniors.
 
Telehealth has been a godsend for millions of Americans receiving health care services during the pandemic while ensuring the spread of the virus stays at a minimum. Our nation‚Äôs entrepreneurs are crucial in rebuilding our economy. 

My bipartisan Enhancing Entrepreneurship for the 21st Century Act is just one of the many tools we can enact to get the American economy back on track.

We‚Äôll never forget the horror of that day, but the resolve of those who responded overshadows the hate. We're forever #BostonStrong Glad to see this admin issue its first-ever presidential proclamation to mark #BlackMaternalHealthWeek. Systemic racial inequalities in maternal health must be addressed so we can stem high death rates among Black mothers. https://t.co/Ui3370aRtA NEW: @POTUS signed my bipartisan bill w/@SenatorCollins into law to prevent Medicare payment cuts to health care providers from taking effect until 2022. Now is not the time to pull the rug out from health care providers who are facing $$ shortfalls as they fight COVID. https://t.co/o6O1cE1k6w Women &amp; children fleeing violence have been vulnerable to homelessness during COVID, yet they don't have protections to fight housing discrimination. I'm reintroducing a bill to fix this egregious discrepancy in civil rights &amp; expand housing protections for victims of violence. https://t.co/eWRyxLgsd6 It is long overdue that Vladimir Putin &amp; his thugs suffer consequences for their continuing malign behavior that for too long went unchecked.

It lays a foundation for success, &amp; it‚Äôs crucial we meet the needs of families &amp; address learning losses due to COVID. #WOYC21 One of the most dangerous policies from the Trump admin was its ban that prevented family planning clinics from referring women for abortion services. Pleased to see @POTUS reverse this ban &amp; expand access to holistic family planning.  
https://t.co/puhi6Cfx4W In NH &amp; across the U.S., PFAS contamination poses risks to local water supplies. @SenatorHassan, @SenAngusKing &amp; I are calling on @SecYellen to allow states &amp; local communities to use funding from the American Rescue Plan to address PFAS contamination. https://t.co/5AmcV7XpWs Glad to announce w/ @SenatorHassan, @RepAnnieKuster &amp; @RepChrisPappas $2.7M for Pease, Lebanon &amp; Manchester Airports.

Tune in below! https://t.co/53pHVfcm9s It undermines our commitment to the Afghan people, particularly Afghan women. I urge the Biden admin to make every effort between now and September to safeguard the progress made and support our partners in the formation of an inclusive, transitional government. I‚Äôm very disappointed in @POTUS' decision to set a Sept. deadline to walk away from Afghanistan. Although this decision was made in coordination w/our allies, the U.S. has sacrificed too much to bring stability to Afghanistan to leave w/o verifiable assurances of a secure future. https://t.co/OfHx3cmJX1 Excited that Somersworth will soon be home to the world‚Äôs first Little Indonesia district! This is an incredible milestone for NH‚Äôs Indonesian community, which enriches the culture &amp; fabric of our Seacoast region. https://t.co/lXyJPn17nL Great to see our local craft breweries thriving following legislation I helped pass to permanently reduce excise taxes on craft beer production, giving them more flexibility during COVID.

There can be no equivocation: Prioritizing women‚Äôs inclusion and rights in Afghanistan must be a U.S. foreign policy priority. https://t.co/mgC0KxMq7m The Kremlin‚Äôs increased aggression against Ukraine cannot be overlooked. Glad @SecDef &amp; @SecBlinken are engaging w/our allies to reaffirm U.S. support for Ukraine‚Äôs sovereignty. Putin must be held to account for unrelenting hostility that threatens our transatlantic community. https://t.co/tkSeyrTaPx April is #ChildAbusePreventionMonth. Let‚Äôs work together to ensure no child suffers abuse or neglect, and ensure survivors have the resources they need to heal. 58 years since that tragic day, we honor the fathers, sons, brothers, husbands &amp; friends who lost their lives aboard the USS Thresher.

The U.S. must work w/allies do everything in its power to stop the Kremlin from spreading its malign influence, which threatens U.S. national security &amp; the transatlantic community. 150 million stimulus checks have been sent to families, educators, small business owners, health care workers &amp; so many who are in need of relief. The #AmericanRescuePlan is helping families from all walks of life during this crisis. https://t.co/SFGLP0ONlp From Boulder to Atlanta, mass shootings have taken too many innocent lives this year.

https://t.co/4mLDzbTjeJ The stories go on &amp; highlight why the ACA has been such a consequential step forward for so many Granite Staters &amp; Americans. But our work isn't over ‚Äì I'll continue to fight to expand access to quality, affordable health care that all Americans deserve. As a college student, Tiffany from Dover struggled to afford the costs of treatment &amp; care for her autoimmune disorder. Though she had health insurance, it was the norm for companies to deny care or increase costs for Americans w/pre-existing conditions. The ACA changed that. James from Keene &amp; his wife lost their health insurance after she was laid off ‚Äì making a stressful situation even worse. The ACA helps Americans when they need a hand because cost should never be a barrier to care,‚ÄØ&amp; allowed this couple to #GetCovered thru the ACA Marketplace. Christine from Goffstown had left her job and with it, her employer-sponsored health care plan. To make matters worse, the high cost of COBRA made paying to stay on her old plan out of the question. The ACA opened up options that she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to afford otherwise. David from Merrimack is a proud dad who wants the best for his kids. When his son graduated from college amid an economic downturn, David was worried he'd be left without health insurance. Thanks to the ACA, Americans under 26‚ÄØlike David‚Äôs son‚ÄØcan stay on their parents‚Äô plan. This week, we celebrated the 11th anniversary of the ACA, legislation that changed the way we view health care in the U.S. ‚Äì as a right, not a privilege. To mark the occasion, I want to share some of the stories I've heard from Granite Staters on what the ACA means for them. Henniker native Amy Beach is one of America‚Äôs greatest composers. A prodigy who memorized 40 songs by the age of 1, Amy became the first American woman to compose and publish a symphony and receive global acclaim. Proud to honor her this #WomensHistoryMonth. https://t.co/64sHx0YAVr U.S. national forests provide clean air, serve as wildlife refuges &amp; support our outdoor recreation economy. Glad to join @SenStabenow &amp; @senrobportman on this bill to address deforestation on public lands &amp; create new jobs by planting 1.2 billion trees. https://t.co/webpvwwHGx New Hampshire's private forests preserve our natural resources, help our climate and are a staple of our rural economy. I‚Äôm proud to lead this bipartisan bill with @SenCapito to help forest landowners and building owners make decisions with an eye toward sustainability. https://t.co/g7oqEaIvUs The substance use disorder epidemic in New Hampshire has been harrowing, and it's gotten worse since COVID-19 hit. That's why I'm joining this bipartisan effort to invest in education, prevention, treatment and recovery programs across the country. https://t.co/hawgbekxlM Pleased that following my call along with the NH delegation, @FEMA will fully reimburse NH for key emergency protective measures taken during COVID. Our local communities severely strained their budgets to respond to the pandemic, &amp; these federal resources will help them rebound. We must ensure the federal government can access critical national security supplies from U.S. companies when crises strike. My bipartisan bill does just that by bolstering our domestic supply chain to ensure we're prepared. https://t.co/l0Tj2GSqzF NEW ENROLLMENT DEADLINE! Granite Staters have until Aug 15 to enroll in health insurance plans for coverage in 2021. If you receive health care through the Health Insurance Marketplace, you can claim the *new premium tax credits* by visiting https://t.co/upkeVVxRJL after April. https://t.co/AWopl7BOJZ Our rural businesses in NH are the backbone of our economy, supplying jobs &amp; spurring economic growth. But they often are denied access to venture capital, which is why I'm joining a bipartisan effort to make more funds available to invest in rural biz. https://t.co/a2C5xqxAR5 üö®The Senate has passed my bipartisan bill w/@SenatorCollins that will delay cuts to Medicare reimbursements our health care providers are relying on to keep their doors open during COVID-19. I urge the House to act on this legislation ASAP. https://t.co/mfJWUyFtOl Too many Granite Staters have been on the brink of eviction during this pandemic. Today I joined the NH delegation urging @HUDgov to support mediation programs between landlords &amp; tenants to stem the housing crisis. https://t.co/kWFbB49CGi NH community health centers will be receiving $20.2M to expand COVID-19 testing! This is funding I fought to secure in the #AmericanRescuePlan &amp; will put us one step closer to ensuring all Granite Staters are able to get vaccinated &amp; ending this virus. https://t.co/KUGPVMAKlG NEW: the PPP Extension Act that I authored w/@SenatorCollins &amp; @SenatorCardin cleared the Senate and is heading to the President‚Äôs desk! The PPP has been vital for NH #smallbiz &amp; non-profits ‚Äì helping more than 36k to date, which is why extending this deadline was crucial. https://t.co/hRyuPwn1aV The impact substance use disorders have on our loved ones is heartbreaking, &amp; COVID has only worsened this crisis by imposing more stress, isolation &amp; economic insecurity. Today I reintroduced my bill to invest $63 billion to bolster our national response to this crisis. üëá https://t.co/9nIAxAzakv Excited to welcome New England‚Äôs first whitewater park to NH this summer! Mill City Park will be a cornerstone of our outdoor recreation &amp; tourism economy. I‚Äôm proud to have been an early supporter &amp; I‚Äôm excited to see kayakers in the Winnipesaukee River. https://t.co/7oOZplqmcP .@EPANewEngland‚Äôs Healthy Communities Grant Program is now OPEN! These grants help improve the quality of life in communities across NH by addressing environmental &amp; human health risks. Apply below by May 14th. https://t.co/nq5Xox6aw5 Very encouraged to see @SecBlinken reaffirm U.S. commitment to NATO. I re-established the Senate NATO Observer Group in the Senate because our transatlantic bonds help keep the U.S. safe &amp; secure and maintain global stability. Most simply put: it‚Äôs good to have friends. https://t.co/XgmywSBBvF üö® The PPP Exention Act is moving forward. The Paycheck Protection Program has been a lifeline for small businesses ‚Äì this is a common-sense step Congress needs to take. Glad to partner w/ @SenatorCollins &amp; ¬†@SenatorCardin to drive this forward. On average women make 82 cents for every $1 men make. This disparity is indefensible, &amp; it‚Äôs even more egregious for women of color. 

#EqualPayDay is a reminder that we must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to ensure women are paid fair wages for their work. https://t.co/3jGxLJbT3W ICYMI: This week I met w/ NH Commerce Corridor Chamber Coalition &amp; @SenatorHassan on new relief heading to small businesses through the #AmericanRescuePlan. Great to check in w/ our community leaders &amp; discuss this important relief for NH. https://t.co/ZgHNhDp8O6 Addressing our nation‚Äôs crumbling infrastructure &amp; investing in good-paying, clean energy jobs is essential to overcome this financial crisis. I‚Äôm eager to work with @POTUS to invest in our American workers &amp; families to get through this pandemic. https://t.co/cTvErJtwEs Today I chaired my 1st Europe &amp; Regional Cooperation SFRC subcommittee hearing of the 117th Congress on bolstering support for Georgia in light of the political crisis. The message today was clear: there is strong bipartisan support for Georgia's path to democracy. My readoutüó£Ô∏è: https://t.co/AfQ3YqjUDg This is great news! Vaccines will get us to the other side of this pandemic. Thank you @POTUS &amp; @VP for your leadership in helping every American ‚Äì regardless of zip code or income ‚Äì access vaccines. üëè https://t.co/kuxbnmKVLY Encouraged the Biden admin is using the diplomatic tools I helped establish to stop NS2 ‚Äì that must continue to prevent this pipeline from being completed &amp; stop the Kremlin‚Äôs goal of further spreading its malign influence throughout Europe. My letter today w/ @SenatorMenendez: https://t.co/MnDsMT0tQq Very glad to announce that @MentalHealthNH will receive $400K to help implement comprehensive suicide prevention programs that will raise awareness &amp; increase access to mental health services &amp; treatment for Granite Staters in crisis. https://t.co/uski1p0sDB Small &amp; minority-owned businesses will fall through the cracks if we don‚Äôt extend the deadline for vital assistance through the #PaycheckProtection Program. There is robust support for my bill w/ @SenatorCollins &amp; @SenatorCardin to extend this lifeline. Let‚Äôs get this done. https://t.co/OUaxT3ovSU As New Hampshire Maple Month draws to an end, it is yet another reminder that the Granite State really does have the best maple syrup to offer in the country. @SenatorHassan wouldn‚Äôt you agree? The provisions I recently included in the #AmericanRescuePlan will expand coverage &amp; reduce costs for millions of Americans. Granite Staters have until May 15 to sign up for health insurance through the ACA ‚Äì I encourage everyone to visit https://t.co/jZzBconlSo &amp; #GetCovered. The ACA changed the way we view health care in the U.S. ‚Äì as a right, not a privilege. 11 years later ‚Äì with millions covered due to the health care law ‚Äì we look back on how far we‚Äôve come &amp; recommit to finishing what we started by ensuring cost is never a barrier to care. Thank you to @EndowmentHealth &amp; Dr. Yvonne Goldsberry for this uplifting message &amp; your work to keep NH‚Äôs most vulnerable communities healthy. They call us Granite Staters for a reason ‚Äì we are strong &amp; resilient, and together we‚Äôre going to get to the other side of this crisis. https://t.co/x4osFCssQ2 Homelessness in NH increased by 20% between 2019 &amp; 2020. Communities in crisis need help now, &amp; this week #WaypointSleepOut2021 is raising awareness. We must work together to ensure relief I helped secure through the #AmericanRescuePlan gets to our most vulnerable. https://t.co/p7zk3VhMNe My thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the innocent lives viciously taken tonight, and the entire Boulder community. This has to stop - mass shootings cannot be a norm in American society. We can and must enact common-sense gun reform to end this violence. https://t.co/ivT1W19qJZ As we focus on recovery from this financial crisis, we need smart, capable leaders who have our workers‚Äô backs. @marty_walsh is an excellent choice to lead @USDOL, &amp; I look forward to working with him to strengthen our workforce &amp; invest in job creation, development &amp; training. https://t.co/cpvY1m6fjK Access to clean water is a necessity, especially as we face down a global public health crisis. On #WorldWaterDay, we must recommit to taking meaningful action that provides access to clean water &amp; sanitation at home &amp; around the world. https://t.co/5cPQOsSWbt Great to meet w/ NH Commerce Corridor Chamber Coalition w/@SenatorHassan this morning to discuss new relief heading to our small businesses through the #AmericanRescuePlan. I'll keep fighting to put our small businesses &amp; entrepreneurs at the forefront of our recovery efforts. Since the start of COVID, @NHNationalGuard has been on the frontlines delivering essential services &amp; resources to communities across NH. Our guard members have been core to our response and recovery efforts, &amp; I‚Äôm grateful for their service each &amp; every day. https://t.co/8dEI4roOFy .@SecBlinken‚Äôs trip to Brussels comes at a critical time as we reaffirm our commitment to our @NATO allies &amp;  partners. Our national security is bolstered by the strength of our alliances. I look forward to working w/ @SecBlinken through my role on @SenateForeign. https://t.co/AQvzlZEwNr Happy to join @SenatorFeinstein &amp; my fellow women Senators to make it official &amp; declare March  #WomensHistoryMonth! This resolution symbolizes the immense contributions of women throughout history &amp; those who continue to shape our nation today. https://t.co/Aw9gktJbOi Thrilled to announce $2.3M through the Great American Outdoors Act to help establish the Dundee Community Forest! This new forest partnership will enhance the North Country's outdoor rec economy, protect wildlife habitat &amp; ensure visitors can enjoy this land in the years to come. https://t.co/uHXGpWBthw More than 13.5K Granite State women, infants &amp; children rely on WIC to receive healthy, nutritious food. I‚Äôll keep urging @USDA to improve the WIC program so NH families &amp; more across the country can access critical nutrition assistance. https://t.co/MbJcgtI6Ha As our nation confronts new &amp; hybrid threats from adversaries, experienced &amp; resolute leadership in our intelligence community is paramount. William Burns is supremely qualified to lead the @CIA &amp; I look forward to working w/him to protect our people &amp; country at home and abroad. https://t.co/Vx7pILoI8y Monumental news: 100 million Americans will be vaccinated by the end of today ahead of @POTUS‚Äôs first 100 days. This has been a harrowing year, but because communities came together to meet the crisis &amp; thanks to POTUS‚Äôs leadership, we are starting to turn the corner. https://t.co/41bdr4MlXR Great news from @SBAgov! New economic relief is heading to local venues through the SVOG program starting April 8th. These grants will help keep our favorite local businesses open, &amp; relief can't come soon enough. Sign up for updates here: https://t.co/84PMnSsUtH Today I visited @NHFB's mobile food pantry to highlight food &amp; nutrition assistance in the #AmericanRescuePlan. The food insecurity crisis in NH has been worsened by COVID, which is why I worked to secure relief to help vulnerable families put food on the table. https://t.co/oIHvNjZFG0 During #WomensHistoryMonth, we honor Harriet Tubman for her legacy as an abolitionist &amp; hero. But we can do better. Let‚Äôs cement her story on our U.S. currency to ensure an everyday reminder about who she was &amp; what she did. It‚Äôs time to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill. https://t.co/ZEGJjPUrIi From students enrolled in virtual classes to families trying to stay in touch with loved ones during COVID, Granite Staters need access to high-speed internet. I'm joining a bill to ensure small broadband providers can continue offering free &amp; low-cost internet to those in need. https://t.co/Bh4Kg9qzn6 Congrats to Yunseo Choi, a talented student from Phillips Exeter Academy in NH who won 1st place this year in the prestigious science &amp; math competition for high school seniors, the Regeneron Science Talent Search. https://t.co/mkGm2KsW3k Children across America w/ stutters see themselves reflected in @POTUS, &amp; I applaud this new project to empower bright young minds like NH‚Äôs own Brayden Harrington to practice public speaking through poetry.

Welcome news from the @IRS: Families now have more time to file their taxes. This filing extension comes at a critical time as taxpayers grapple with the economic fallout from COVID-19. For more information visit: https://t.co/SO4mOX3zFU. https://t.co/xTN2vaQaXw Scammers preying on Granite Staters during this economic crisis must be held to account. Please notify @ConcordPD if you receive spoof calls fishing for your money.
https://t.co/xa4h4zz1CR History made: @XavierBecerra will be the 1st Latino to lead @HHSgov. I look forward to working w/him to end the COVID-19 global health crisis, expand access to affordable health care for families in NH &amp; across the nation, combat the substance use disorder epidemic &amp; more. https://t.co/rEChYljMZ6 Survivors of domestic &amp; sexual violence are facing isolation during COVID &amp; NH crisis centers have seen an increase in demand for services. It‚Äôs unconscionable that Congress allowed #VAWA to expire - the Senate must act now to help survivors access support &amp; safety. https://t.co/JHbS6HVHiG Glad to see the Biden admin reaffirm the importance of the diplomatic tools I worked on in Congress to halt NS2. Stopping the completion of this pipeline is about safeguarding our transatlantic community from Putin‚Äôs malign influence &amp; defending Europe‚Äôs energy supplies. https://t.co/trYbISioaC Small biz are hurting &amp; need help, which is why the Senate must pass the companion bill to my legislation with @SenatorCollins &amp; @SenatorCardin that will extend the deadline for PPP. The House acted ‚Äì the Senate must follow suit. There's no time to waste. https://t.co/Uvp2DbnTP4 COVID testing is key to safely reopening our schools. That's why I'm glad to announce NH schools will receive $40.9M from @HHSgov through the #AmericanRescuePlan to ramp up COVID testing, which will help more kids to return to class &amp; protect the health of students &amp; staff. Especially in the midst of a public health crisis, cost should not be a barrier to medical care or medicine. Glad to lead this bipartisan bill to ease finances for many families by bringing more generic drugs to the market, increasing competition and driving down costs. https://t.co/VrEd1GF1TA Grateful to meet w/@FLOTUS ahead of her NH trip to discuss her visit to Christa McAuliffe Elementary &amp; Christa's legacy in NH and how the #AmericanRescuePlan will help NH schools, families &amp; more. I‚Äôll keep working w/the WH to ensure NH has the help it needs to recover &amp; rebuild. https://t.co/iECnLpoHKs Today, a commemorative coin that was created in her honor starts shipping. My bipartisan bill w/@SenatorEnzi that was signed into law authorized the creation of this coin &amp; proceeds will honor her legacy by supporting @FRCTeams &amp; STEM education. https://t.co/n2CptG7UZi NH is forever proud to call Christa McAuliffe one of our own.

I‚Äôm proud of our Guardsmen &amp; women for their leadership &amp; service, at home and abroad. https://t.co/5uHoeFo2Jd Unleashing the full potential of energy efficiency is key to rebuilding &amp; strengthening our economy post-pandemic. Today I led a letter to @POTUS urging funding for programs that promote energy efficiency to combat climate change &amp; create good-paying sustainable jobs. https://t.co/mLeKT5VCoK My thoughts are with the families of those whose lives were viciously taken in Atlanta. The escalation of hate crimes against Asian American communities demands a robust response to end the violence and bring those culpable to justice. Great news! NH will get $$ thru the Great American Outdoors Act for critical maintenance of our forests. @WhiteMountainNF selected projects include Sawyer River Bridge, Mt. Washington Valley Chocorua Trails &amp; White Mountain Snowmobile Corridor 19 Trail Bridge Replacement. https://t.co/EYjslCQ3H9 Preventing domestic abusers from accessing firearms should not be a controversial concept. This legislation would help save lives by helping to keep firearms out of the hands of those who wish to do harm. Congress needs to get this done &amp; amend the law to protect survivors. https://t.co/6Icp4Vq6bO Looking forward to sitting down w/ @FLOTUS &amp; @SenatorHassan to discuss the critical issues impacting NH working families, combating COVID-19 &amp; delivering relief through the #AmericanRescuePlan to get our communities to the other side of this crisis. https://t.co/XJqedUvQAL COVID has devastated our hospitality &amp; tourism businesses, but we‚Äôre starting to turn the corner w/ crucial help from the #AmericanRescuePlan.

Looking forward to working with her to serve NH &amp; America's small biz. https://t.co/xXElFGeAQg Americans with pre-existing conditions should never be denied access to health care. Today I introduced a bill w/ @MarkWarner to undo a Trump-era rule that promoted junk health care plans that exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions. Health care is a right, not a privilege. https://t.co/4D6IcjTVNZ Exciting to see NH biz gearing up for the warmer weather &amp; outdoor dining season. Our restaurants have been among the hardest-hit by #COVID19. There is $28.6B to help our restaurants in the #AmericanRescuePlan. Now it‚Äôs let's get that money out the door. https://t.co/WU7biPNpR4 As transportation hubs, NH airports are key to NH‚Äôs infrastructure &amp; economy.

For many providers, looming Medicare payment cuts could make it harder to keep their doors open when they are most needed. .@DebHaalandNM has a track record of defending our great outdoors and fighting to preserve our treasured lands and wildlife.

For 10 years, the Syrian people have endured more trials and tribulations than most can bear to imagine.

"Shelby, Richard ",SenShelby,,Alabama,Alabama,Senator," Talk is cheap, but defending our country is not.

Grateful for our longstanding friendship and willingness to work together on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Looking forward to another productive year. Pleased that 20 airports throughout Alabama will benefit from more than $11.2M in @FAAnews grants. These @USDOT funds will help airports receive the upgrades and enhancements needed to continue serving local communities and driving economic development. https://t.co/amCDQCO8Qc More information regarding my letter: https://t.co/IRs5VU7iNu Today I sent a letter to @Amtrak, @CSX, @nscorp, &amp; Surface Transportation Board stating that a data-driven process is essential prior to starting new passenger rail in Mobile. A comprehensive study would alleviate concerns re how the new service could impact growth in the area. https://t.co/aV886rim9I Please stay safe as we work to assess the damage in Alabama. To the first responders who have worked hard to rescue those in need, thank you. My thoughts and prayers are with all of those experiencing loss and destruction as a result of the devastating storms that hit the entire southeast yesterday. Further, S.1 would allow the use of taxpayer dollars for political campaigns. I vehemently oppose this bill and urge every one of my colleagues in Congress to do the same. This legislation would have dangerous implications on the future of our democracy. 3/3 Not only would S.1 give unelected, ultraliberal Washington bureaucrats the ability to control how Alabama conducts its elections, but it would open doors to fraud and have a devastating impact on our freedom of speech. 2/3 S.1 is a blatant power grab in an effort to force a federalized election system on the entire country. 1/3 In 2016, I worked to have Congress fund this $10 million, state-of-the-art study &amp; I'm very pleased with its results. The Gulf's ""Great Red Snapper Count"" revealed 110 million red snapper, approximately three times more than previously estimated. This is fantastic news. https://t.co/qOrlq67b2w Pleased that @ARCgov granted @AthensAL $750K for the installation of new sewer infrastructure to the Huntsville-Browns Ferry Rd Interchange on I-65. This funding will support the construction of new facilities designed to help traffic near the Mazda-Toyota plant being built. https://t.co/ulHVuAWhKx Today is #NationalAgDay!

Please be sure to monitor the forecast &amp; take the necessary precautions, such as establishing multiple ways to get weather updates, having an appropriate plan, &amp; identifying your shelter. #alwx https://t.co/VL0FQtwbzZ As we state in the letter, ‚Äúthe President‚Äôs actions directly contributed to this unfortunate, yet entirely avoidable, scenario,‚Äù and are ‚Äúa blatant violation of federal law and infringe on Congress‚Äôs constitutional power of the purse.‚Äù I joined 39 of my @SenateGOP colleagues in sending a letter, led by @SenCapito, to @USGAO regarding @POTUS‚Äôs unlawful suspension of border wall funding and construction, and how those actions have directly contributed to the crisis at our southern border. https://t.co/jwsEN5HHXE Pleased that HomTex, a #CullmanCounty textile manufacturer, received @US_FDA‚Äôs greenlight for its Level 1 Surgical masks. This secures the growing Alabama company's entry into the PPE market, which is also on track to open a plant in Selma, resulting in 300 new jobs. #MadeinAL https://t.co/uRPns6GvQg This week in the Senate, I cosponsored legislation to repeal the #DeathTax, which is an unfair tax that makes it more difficult for hardworking farms &amp; small businesses to stay in the family. It's important that we ease the burden on these family businesses, not exacerbate it. I look forward to working with the Consortium, including the @UofSouthAlabama, @UofAlabama, @AuburnU, and @ALPublicHealth, to ensure that innovative solutions are identified &amp; a more resilient sustainable wastewater infrastructure is constructed throughout the region. Pleased to announce that an AL Consortium has been granted a $4.85M Rural Water &amp; Wastewater Treatment award by @USDA. This funding will help strengthen wastewater treatment to improve public health &amp; economic development, specifically in the Black Belt. 
https://t.co/aGIK9N20VN Pleased with the progress at the Port of Mobile. The deepening &amp; widening of the Mobile Harbor will increase #Alabama‚Äôs global competitiveness, create jobs throughout the state, and serve as a catalyst for economic opportunities. @AlabamaPortAuth https://t.co/0CLDb8AzLJ I am disappointed that we were blocked at every turn from engaging and passing real COVID relief in a bipartisan, targeted manner, just like the Senate did five times last year.
https://t.co/PCUwhz0CR8 The bill does nothing to get kids back in classrooms and, instead, includes a massive cash bailout for some mismanaged states and local governments. This is unacceptable. Not only does it cost American taxpayers over a trillion dollars, but only 9% of the funding in the bill goes toward the immediate fight against COVID and 1% toward vaccines. Dems are forcing a liberal wish list of pet projects through Congress that's masked as a rescue package. Today I voted against the Dems' $1.9 trillion COVID bill for several reasons. This legislation includes a host of non-COVID-related left-wing policies and could further wreck the economy and ignite inflation. 
https://t.co/PCUwhz0CR8 These @AlabamaFTBL athletes &amp; coaches demonstrated tremendous fortitude, ending the season 13-0. The team went 11-0 in conference play, becoming the first team in college football history to win 11 @SEC games in a season, &amp; averaged 48.5 points per game ‚Äì the most in SEC history. The Senate has passed my resolution commending the @UofAlabama Crimson Tide on winning the 2021 @NCAA College Football Nat'l Championship ‚Äì the 18th Nat'l Championship for @AlabamaFTBL, and 6th in the last 11 years. I‚Äôm proud to formally recognize this achievement. #RollTide https://t.co/xnYt50KVNq Last year, the Senate worked together 5 times to pass bipartisan, targeted COVID relief to help combat the pandemic and get Americans' lives back to normal. This year, Democrats are pushing a partisan $1.9 trillion package filled with unrelated, self-serving liberal priorities. This COVID relief package is partisan &amp; non-targeted. In fact, 90% of Dems‚Äô COVID relief package is unrelated to COVID. Instead, Democrats want to expand Obamacare subsidies, push harmful economic policies, &amp; fund blue state bailouts, Planned Parenthood, union pensions, &amp; more. In Democrats‚Äô massive $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, very little is actually related to the pandemic. In fact, less than 9% of Democrats‚Äô proposal would go to the core healthcare fight against COVID-19, and less than 1% deals with vaccinations. Last year, Congress appropriated $68 billion in COVID-related funds for K-12 schools. Of that, only $5 billion has been spent. Schools have the resources to reopen and science has shown that it's safe to do so with simple precautions that we can accomplish right now. FAA selected Huntsville Intl Airport to host a UAS Test Site to evaluate drone detection &amp; mitigation systems. @FlyHSV, in partnership with @UAHuntsville, will work to foster new technologies that'll make airports safer for passengers &amp; aircraft. Excellent decision &amp; great news. https://t.co/IupPrP0nzC Today I questioned Gary Gensler, POTUS's SEC nominee, about the importance of utilizing economic analysis when proposing and adopting rules within the SEC. Identifying the potential benefits and costs of a regulation is essential in determining if it is in the public interest. https://t.co/cP1rDXtxhs A grant of nearly $745K has been awarded to Physicians Care of Clarke in #ClarkeCounty. This investment will increase their telehealth capacity through the installation of telemedicine carts and videoconferencing equipment at each clinic. $790K has been awarded to @CahabaMedical to fund teleconferencing equipment in central Alabama. This grant will enable the foundation to offer distance learning for its family medicine residency programs, which help graduates achieve licensure or board certification. #Centreville .@Montevallo University has received $580K to establish a telemedicine system to provide access to telemental health services for students, teachers, and community members. The #LauderdaleCounty Board of Education has been awarded approximately $250K to purchase and install distance learning systems in their schools that will increase student's access to their teachers and lessons. The @UofAlabama received $900K to increase patient care efficiency by establishing a network between 23 telemedicine-equipped ambulances and seven rural hospitals in west-central Alabama, which will allow patient data to be relayed directly to emergency physicians. Alabama received a total of $3.3M in Distance, Learning &amp; Telemedicine grants from @USDA today. This #telehealth investment will help combat the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in rural areas by increasing access to quality healthcare &amp; education. https://t.co/egKbpGIO7Z Congratulations to Bob Jones High School in Madison, Alabama, on winning their regional Science Bowl event and advancing to the National Finals this May.

For everything, there is a season. I am grateful to the people of Alabama who have put their trust in me for more than forty years. https://t.co/UXNJyc3OPC George Shultz was a great statesman. He held four cabinet positions and served under three different presidents. He was smart and wise, and dedicated his life to our country. We will miss his rational mind. This week I nominated 39 students from across Alabama to attend various U.S. service academies. These students have excellent academic records &amp; achievements outside the classroom. Their futures are bright! @NavalAcademy @AF_Academy @WestPoint_USMA @UsmmaO https://t.co/Ry3ISI73rr Congratulations to Ann Berry, the new Secretary of the Senate. Ann is a Birmingham native and the first African American and Alabamian to serve in this role. Having worked in the Senate for 40 years, she is well respected and will continue to be an asset in her new position. Cosponsored a resolution, which just passed in the Senate, honoring the life and legacy of Hank Aaron for his vast accomplishments. The Mobile native was an impressive athlete and continues to be a role model to many. He earned his place in history and deserves this recognition. Secretary Austin and I also discussed my belief that robust investments in readiness and modernization are essential to maintaining a world-renowned military. We live in a troubled world. The defense of our nation must be our number one priority. @DeptofDefense 2/2 Today I spoke with @SecDef Lloyd Austin and reiterated my hope that the Biden Administration‚Äôs top priority will be the security of our nation. I told him that we must have the best trained, best led, and best equipped military in the world. 1/2 Some great news for Alabama from @CSpire today.

I look forward to working with him to ensure our military remains the most powerful force in the world. @DeptofDefense Last week @SenRobPortman and I made a friendly wager ahead of the Alabama-Ohio State #NationalChampionship game. On the line was some ribs from Alabama‚Äôs @DreamlandBBQ &amp; a few pints of Ohio's @graeters ice cream. Looking forward to enjoying some ice cream.

Sicknick, who died in the line of duty, courageously protecting others from harm. 3/3 I want to thank the law enforcement officials who bravely restored order and protected those working in the Capitol complex. Additionally, I believe a thorough examination of Capitol security measures is necessary to prevent this from ever happening again. 2/3 The chilling events that unfolded Wednesday on Capitol Hill were unacceptable. The rule of law is one of our nation‚Äôs founding principles, and we cannot tolerate such violence and chaos. 1/3 Today is a very dark day for our country. I am safe thanks to the protection and swift action by our law enforcement officials. Our Founding Fathers warned against mob rule. Law and order must be established and maintained.

https://t.co/oUOtaO32Vr I'm hopeful that we can reach a resolution soon on both. The American people expect us do our job, which includes providing government agencies, in particular our military and veterans, with needed funding. The Senate just passed a continuing resolution through December 18. This will keep the govt open and give us another week to continue our discussions on the FY21 appropriations bills. This also provides members the opportunity to continue negotiations on additional COVID relief. Remember to #shopsmall and support your local small businesses this holiday season.

"Smith, Tina",SenTinaSmith,TinaSmithMN,Minnesota,Minnesota,Senator," But we can‚Äôt look away. And I will keep working for Congress to pass serious policing reform. 

To my colleagues: we have power to make real change, let's use it. So much trauma. 13 years old, hands raised. I‚Äôm flying home to take care of my grandson tomorrow, and I cannot bear to watch a video of a mother‚Äôs child killed by police. This isn't the end of the work I'm doing on making prescription drugs affordable for everyone. There is so much work ahead.
 
But this is an important step forward and I'm glad it looks like we are on course to make it law. Thanks @SenBillCassidy for working with me on this. The bill is pretty simple. Drug companies like pulling this trick where they make some minor, insignificant change to their drugs and then get to extend their rights to keep the price up for five more years.
 
If the President signs this bill, they can't do that anymore. Have some exciting news. I've been working for months on a bipartisan bill to lower prescription drug prices.
 
Today, it officially passed through Congress and is headed for Biden's desk. We need justice for Daunte Wright and his family. We cannot say in this moment, ‚ÄúOh there is nothing we can do. This is something we have to live with.‚Äù

We all must rise to the call to action, we cannot look away and allow injustice to continue. The problem is not that we don't have solutions, the problem is we face significant obstacles from our colleagues. 

It's amongst other reasons why I've come out in support of eliminating the filibuster. I‚Äôve pushed hard for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and other pieces of legislation that would help local communities like Brooklyn Center move forward with real innovations in public safety that would help keep everybody safe. We need to ban chokeholds, develop a national use of force standard, and make it easier to hold law enforcement accountable when they use excessive force.

We have the power to resolve many of these systemic problems at the federal level. It is deplorable that in this country, in my state, you can end up dead from a traffic stop. This is an epidemic of Black people being killed by the police during routine interactions.

But we should not pretend we are powerless in the face of this public health crisis. The @FEMA vaccination site at the MN state fairgrounds opens today! Minnesotans living in zip codes near the fairgrounds should sign up through the @mnhealth  Vaccine Connector to get notifications about appointments. #DontWaitVaccinate

@SenWarren and I are fighting back. Wall Street banks aren't above the law. Ramadan Mubarak! Wishing those in Minnesota and around the world a blessed #Ramadan. May this holy month bring peace to you and your loved ones. I‚Äôm with @SenWarren: the Biden-Harris Administration should cancel up to $50K in federal student loan debt.

And I'm looking forward to Sen. Warren leading today‚Äôs hearing on the impact of student debt on racial justice, borrowers and the economy. This is important. Black, Brown, Indigenous and all people of color are overpoliced and underprotected. Traffic stops should not be fatal, killing unarmed Black people like Daunte Wright. We have a bill named after George Floyd to dramatically reform policing. So guess who is choosing inaction? A difficult night in Minnesota. We mourn with Daunte Wright‚Äôs family as another Black man‚Äôs life is lost at the hands of law enforcement.

Minnesota has five Division I men‚Äôs college hockey teams and for the first time ever all five have made the 16-team NCAA tournament.  That‚Äôs nearly one-third of the field. We truly are the State of Hockey. Any questions Wisconsin, Michigan, Massachusetts? Agriculture is the backbone of Minnesota‚Äôs economy. On National Ag Day, I salute all of the hard-working Minnesota farmers and ranchers who not only produce the food and energy America needs, but also enough to feed the world. The alleged Boulder shooter was born April 17, 1999‚Äîjust 3 days before the Columbine massacre, which took place 35 miles away. 
 
We have not passed a single meaningful gun control bill since. 
 
And there are an estimated 393 million guns in America. 
 
#GunReformNow Want to also thank @sedonaprince_ and @alikershner in particular for speaking out about this and bringing attention to this important issue. The @BuzzFeed story has more details but the NCAA needs a full accounting of what happened, and they have a responsibility to move gender equality forward. 

I'm pushing for a full and independent investigation. https://t.co/7vS3AmgEuA The NCAA seemingly has fixed some of this but once the disparities became clear, it just highlighted the many others--everything from the on-court branding to the social media handles. 

We need long term solutions, not just a one-time fix. Across the board the NCAA was not providing equitable support--the men got a full training room, the women were given a single rack of dumbbells. The gender divide extended to the swag, food options and even the types of COVID tests. It's not exactly breaking news that women's athletics has been systematically undervalued, but that's no excuse. It's 2021 for goodness sakes. And last week was truly something else. The @NCAA's start to this year's March Madness was simply unacceptable. 

There were *major* disparities between the resources and support given to women's college teams compared to the men's teams. I'm calling for a full investigation. It shouldn‚Äôt take a public outcry over weight rooms for female athletes to be treated fairly. 

I'm pushing for a full, independent investigation into what happened at the start of March Madness. We need concrete, actionable recommendations for reform going forward. https://t.co/b7T3iWn74P This is what happens when we don‚Äôt have Amway heiresses at the helm of federal agencies devoted to helping students.

Get vaccinated as soon as possible no matter which FDA-authorized vaccine you are administered. They are all safe and effective. https://t.co/TrK23DzaOM My bipartisan one health bill would help make sure preparedness efforts meet the needs of all people, all ages and all communities. Even Dr. Fauci himself recently highlighted the importance of one health with @StephenAtHome. Check out the clip here: https://t.co/en2FVaGlLt A ""one health"" approach is the idea that human, environment and animal health are linked, &amp;¬†should be studied together. CDC confirms that coronavirus originally came from an animal, &amp; our nation must be prepared for the future. That's where the bipartisan bill I intro'd comes in. You can read my full letter I sent to the board. There are no excuses for the drop-off in service constituents have seen over the past year. 

DeJoy has to go. https://t.co/JkSUVRwbja The USPS board (almost entirely controlled by Trump appointees) has told me that DeJoy needs to be cut a break and that USPS needs serious reform. 

I partially agree. There are many steps to reform USPS, the first one is making sure DeJoy is not in charge. Remember DeJoy, Trump's Postmaster General, who was actively working to undermine @USPS right before a major election? 

Well, he's still there and I'm calling for him to be removed. Wonderful news. No one should die because they cannot afford life-saving medication. Thank you for all of your hard work in this fight @NSmithholt12.

I‚Äôll be speaking on the Senate floor at 4:35 PM ET to call out the GOP‚Äôs disgraceful treatment of Deb Haaland and other smart, qualified‚Äîand outspoken‚Äîwomen of color nominated by the Biden Administration. Good morning Minnesota!

It looks like a good day to confirm Deb Haaland for Interior Secretary, and make history. https://t.co/WIpThbMWIM Thank you @SenMarkey.

We need to move this country forward, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve decided to come out in support of eliminating the filibuster. The Senate needs to abolish the filibuster. It‚Äôs undemocratic. I‚Äôve spent a long time thinking about this and I hope you read my thoughts: https://t.co/uSObEqLAZS We must always take care of those who have served in our armed forces. That is why @SenThomTillis and I reintroduced legislation to provide healthcare benefits for veterans who participated in the clean up of nuclear fallout on Enewetak Atoll. This is long overdue. You can read my full statement (as well as which other subcommittees I‚Äôm serving on) here: https://t.co/uTu6hUqa2D Some very exciting news. I‚Äôve been named chair of the Housing, Transportation, and Community Development Subcommittee.
 
We need to make sure every American has a safe, stable, affordable place to live, and improve access to public transportation. Let‚Äôs get to work. Amazon has used multiple scare tactics to prevent employees from exercising their rights to unionize under the law.

The company should know I'm paying close attention to how they conduct themselves during the unionization push in Alabama. The rights of workers must be protected. I'm in. 

One other important part of this bill is that it has a plan to cut child poverty in our country in half. @SenSherrodBrown and @SenatorBennet worked on that piece and I cosponsored.

Thank you, Ms. Lee, for your leadership. At 89, Ms. Opal Lee (now 94) walked from her home in TX to DC to deliver a petition in support of making Juneteenth a national holiday. Last year &amp; 1.5 million petition signatures later, I met Ms. Lee. Today, she's well on her way to 3 million and I was honored to see her again. https://t.co/7IW8sGgHz0 The Equality Act just passed the House. Good.

To my Archie, Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day! https://t.co/uzzJUA9vNn I voted to convict because no reasonable person could believe this would have happened without his betrayal. The facts and the evidence were overwhelming‚Äîformer President Donald Trump lied for months to his supporters, summoned them to Washington, and incited a violent insurrection against our government and our democracy. Think I had a lot on my mind this morning. https://t.co/eWfDQXSsPV It‚Äôs taken me a full night to get over the ridiculous display put on by Trump lawyers in the impeachment trial yesterday. It felt like high school, and I‚Äôm not talking civics class. Thank you House Managers, led by @RepRaskin, for making such a clear, compelling case for our democracy, in the wake of unimaginable personal tragedy. Working moms have borne the brunt of this economic crisis and our childcare system is on the verge of collapse.

@SenWarren and I teamed up to fight for substantial childcare funding‚Äîand now $40 billion is in the proposed relief package. We're fighting to make sure it stays in. Thanks @UPI. Don‚Äôt feel bad. Other senators (read: Republican men) often confuse me with @SenatorBaldwin. As recently as December. So sometimes we dress alike just to screw with them. 

Oh, and Happy Birthday Tammy! https://t.co/SvNNARfzll https://t.co/29CEaB7m1G It is truly amazing what Officer Goodman did under pressure. He lives up to his name.

My prayers go to the victims and their families. And my thanks go to the courageous first responders on the scene who handled a very difficult situation. And I‚Äôll be listening and watching for any sign that seventeen Republican Senators won‚Äôt look the other way and will stand up for our country. [END] Senators will relive the horror of the attack on the Capitol, see and hear new evidence about what happened and the big lie President Trump told that the election was stolen. So as this trial proceeds, from my vantage point in the second row to the left of the dais, I will be listening and watching. I say some Republicans. Not all of them.  I work with Republican colleagues every day, people I respect even when I disagree with them.  I‚Äôm by nature an optimist - how else could I work in the Senate? (Senator Lindsey Graham, who the night of the attack said he ‚Äúwas done,‚Äù tweeted today that he hopes the House Managers won‚Äôt take too long since the outcome of the trial is clear.) But here‚Äôs what really infuriates me: watching some Republican Senators do everything they can to look the other way in order to avoid standing up for our country and against this criminal behavior. And I‚Äôm heartsick that after the windows were broken, and the injured were given aid, the mostly Black custodial staff were left to sweep up the trash in the building built by their enslaved ancestors. I‚Äôm furious that, inside the Senate, some Republican Senators actively supported the lie that the election was stolen, and did what they could to overturn our election. I‚Äôm angry and heartbroken about the loss of Officer Sicknick, and the other Capitol police that died by suicide in the following days. I‚Äôm angry about the staffers and journalists and members of Congress who were terrified for their lives because these people sent by the President were chanting about assassination and lynching. Another impeachment trial has begun in the Senate.

And I am angry.  I‚Äôm angry about the rabid right-wing extremists and white supremacists who attacked our Capitol, so sure they would never pay for their actions because the President had sent them. [THREAD] This #BlackHistoryMonth make sure to visit their fantastic exhibits (following COVID precautions of course) or check out their website for virtual events: https://t.co/tBgzBrnqQf Last year, I had the opportunity to visit the Minnesota African American Heritage Museum and Gallery.

When it's safe to do so, let's go to Daube's again. Looking forward to it! For folks who want to tune in, I‚Äôll be on @TheSundayShow along with @JacksonLeeTX18 tomorrow at 10:15 AM ET/9:15 AM if you‚Äôre in Minnesota. https://t.co/aPAZjSYzkM My Clean Electricity Standard bill is one of the keys to addressing the climate crisis. We need to be ready to use any and all of the legislative tools we have to get it done and done soon‚Äîit‚Äôs just too urgent to do nothing. https://t.co/9SK19RfTJs Go to https://t.co/jqLCBAvHeJ for more information and instructions. Thrilled to see that Minnesotans from Liberia are beginning to get their green cards and eventually become citizens through the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act. The community and I fought hard to make this law and to extend the deadline to apply to December 20th, 2021. Last week, I went over to the Capitol a couple of times to thank the Minnesota Guard troops protecting us and the Capitol (and was able to bring some cookies). Can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate their service to allow our democracy to continue to operate safely and securely. https://t.co/FSg1GuOsNR Folks, we have some great new Democratic Senators who joined the caucus recently.

I can't wait for the day when I can drive from D.C. to Lansing &amp; have enough charging stations to drive home from work! Electric vehicles are a key part of our country‚Äôs future, but you can‚Äôt drive one without sufficient charging stations.
 
The climate crisis is having a harmful effect on Michigan and transitioning to electric vehicles is something we can do now to reduce emissions. Today we remember the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. Her legacy extends far beyond music. 

She is loved and missed every day, especially today, her birthday. MI's small businesses are the backbone of our economy, but many are still struggling to keep the lights on. The bipartisan extension of the Paycheck Protection Program is great news &amp; will help small business owners keep their workers &amp; reopen their doors. https://t.co/jZIq6ZlBxw This is huge! https://t.co/q5kvIC8TAs This pandemic has caused a child hunger crisis that has touched so many families in Michigan and across the country.

I‚Äôve introduced a bill w/ @SenRickScott &amp; @MarcoRubio to accomplish what letters &amp; repeated meetings have not‚Äîdirecting @CDCgov to finally codify timely guidance &amp; a plan for cruise ships to safely &amp; responsibly welcome passengers this summer.

Register here: https://t.co/BQiypeZKco https://t.co/s0GDDPGvHe @AKNewsNow Three areas that enable America to negotiate from a position of strength are our domestic energy sector, our well-funded military, and our wide array of alliances. I urged the administration to strengthen and build upon these huge geostrategic advantages. @AKNewsNow In discussions before and after the diplomatic meetings, I made the case to Secretary of State Blinken and National Security Advisor Sullivan that we need a long-term, bipartisan strategy to deal with the rise of China‚Äîakin to our approach to the Soviet Union. I spoke with Mike Ross on @AKNewsNow to offer my impressions and key takeaways from the recent diplomatic meetings that took place in Anchorage between senior Biden administration and Chinese officials. https://t.co/fTBUmddZHe NOW: Joining @AKNewsNow to talk about the U.S.-China meeting in Anchorage.

The @usairforce today announced it will be adding four KC-135 refueling tanker aircraft to the existing squadron at @EielsonAirForce. I commend the leadership of the #AirForce for this wise allocation of forces.

More here ‚û°Ô∏è  https://t.co/wk1ydSyZCI https://t.co/9Ip3aRlwXt @USArmy This #Army strategy, and those of the other services, sends a strong message to our allies and adversaries that the United States plans to project and sustain power throughout the #Arctic now and into the future. @USArmy I commend the @USArmy, under the leadership of former Secretary McCarthy, acting Secretary Whitley, and Army Chief of Staff General McConville, for their efforts to rebuild the Army‚Äôs #Arctic capabilities, which have atrophied significantly over the past few decades. The @USArmy this week released its first-ever strategy for the #Arctic. The announcement comes as a result of a provision I added to the FY2019 NDAA requiring each branch of the Armed Forces to produce its own Arctic strategy.
 
Read the #Army strategy: https://t.co/TBtyz0Bwx2 https://t.co/xh9W1oeqtc In a recent @SASCGOP hearing, General Glen D. VanHerck, commander of @USNorthernCmd &amp; @NORADCommand, expressed deep concern about America‚Äôs capacity to defend itself against a nuclear missile attack from a rogue threat, like #NorthKorea, in the coming decade. https://t.co/mOc4D4Oh5P Additionally, Ft Greely, a critical missile defense installation in Alaska that would be responsible for defending the homeland from a North Korean missile attack, currently has 20 unfilled interceptor missile silos, and @DeptofDefense has no plan to fill them in the near-term. There are reports that the Biden administration is considering cutting funding for the next generation interceptor (NGI)‚Äîa program intended to replace the existing missile defense ground-based interceptor (GBI) technology and keep pace with the evolving threat from #NorthKorea. It‚Äôs heartening to see‚Äîeven amid the challenges posed by the pandemic, and boycott threats by extreme outside interest groups‚Äîthis great, uniquely Alaskan tradition carrying on.

But self-styled ‚ÄúPresident of the world‚Äù @JohnKerry decidedly isn‚Äôt all in. Who‚Äôs in charge at the @WhiteHouse? https://t.co/VsNnDzXLJs @WhiteHouse Finally, I emphasized that the export of clean burning Alaskan &amp; American natural gas to Asia, including to China, will help dramatically increase American jobs, decrease our trade deficit, enhance our national security, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In my discussions w/ the Biden @WhiteHouse today, I encouraged them to press China on the vital importance of human rights &amp; religious liberty, ensure China fulfills its obligations on matters of trade &amp; reciprocity, &amp; get China to be more transparent on the origins of COVID-19. Alaska is at the center of the strategic crossroads of the world and I am glad that the Biden administration has recognized this by selecting Anchorage as the site of its first official in-person meeting between senior foreign policy officials from the U.S. and China. https://t.co/s45jlFwHXK This is one of many reasons why it is so important for the United States to retain a strong and ready military. https://t.co/Cc13ehJ84j In response to my questioning about China‚Äôs increasingly aggressive actions and the alarming, belligerent behavior of Xi Jinping, Adm.

Instead of maintaining our status as an energy superpower, Biden‚Äôs policies will force the U.S. &amp; our allies to import energy from our adversaries. .@POTUS and @SecBlinken are touting a foreign policy approach that places ‚Äúworking families‚Äù at the center of their national security strategy.

https://t.co/30nYTiAzH4 Here is a link to a speech I gave on the Senate floor in 2019 honoring Bud as one of our Alaskans of the Week in celebration of his 90th birthday: 
https://t.co/ZRCQ5wRLHD Bud was a man of character and keen intelligence who lived a life of service to his country and to our state, in loving partnership with his wonderful wife of 65 years, Mary Jane, who we lost this past April. Bud and Mary Jane are now reunited in eternity. Bud Fate lived a life in full‚Äî91 years. He was surrounded by family and friends until the end. Bud was a role model in every way and I was so blessed to have him as a father-in-law‚Äîthe best one that I could ever imagine. We want to particularly thank those in the Fairbanks community, with whom Bud served nearly all of his life, and who loved him and knew him well. It is with heavy heart, but much appreciation, that Julie and I want to thank all of the Alaskans who have reached out to us and Julie‚Äôs family as we grieve the loss of Dr. Hugh ‚ÄúBud‚Äù Fate, Julie‚Äôs father, a true statesman. https://t.co/tavJHCnSNi @Interior @USFWS @lisamurkowski @repdonyoung I‚Äôd also encourage you to read this letter from KIC President Matthew Rexford with the timeline, emails and details:

Our statement: https://t.co/BZXN0fJJGg

[4/5] @Interior What they didn‚Äôt tell you? @USFWS, an agency of Interior, would not issue approval for KIC to conduct the required aerial surveys. It was a classic bait-and-switch underscoring a bad faith process. 

[3/5] @Interior The Department of the Interior said it wouldn‚Äôt consider the proposal because KIC ‚Äúfailed‚Äù to conduct aerial surveys of polar bear dens by the deadline on February 13.

Vilsack is clearly qualified, having served in the same position previously. However, in our discussions, I encountered a lack of interest in Alaska‚Äôs commercial fishing sector and timber industry‚Äîtwo areas of huge importance to Alaskans where @USDA has a large role. [2/3] Yesterday, I voted against confirming Tom Vilsack as the next Secretary of Agriculture.

Disgraceful. A sad day in American history. The world is watching. We are the United States of America. We must be better than this. We ARE better than this. I look forward to the orderly development in the 1002 Area following the lease sale¬†that will¬†provide good-paying jobs for hard-working Alaskans, fill the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, boost our¬†economy, and enhance America‚Äôs energy security. Judge Gleason followed the law in her decision by recognizing the lack of irreparable harm in letting the lease sale progress. Tomorrow, as required by the 2017¬†Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a lease sale within the 1002 area of #ANWR will occur‚Äîa historic day for Alaska. https://t.co/MUxopDxF57 One of the greatest honors of my life has been the opportunity to serve my fellow Alaskans in the U.S. Senate, and I thank the people of Alaska for their confidence and support in sending me to represent them in Washington for a second term. https://t.co/94IT96liMw https://t.co/uCs9jyweeq Last night, I joined with 91 of my Senate colleagues in voting to pass a new COVID-19 relief and government funding package.

Linda recently received the prestigious #HeinzAward for the Environment for her work championing sustainable fisheries. Congrats, Linda, on being our #AlaskanoftheWeek!

https://t.co/yWB3JKHfoN I commend @POTUS for signing #SaveOurSeas 2.0 into law, and I also thank my SOS colleagues in the House and Senate for being such strong partners and champions for our oceans, fisheries, wildlife and coastal communities. #SaveOurSeas 2.0 will be particularly important for Alaska, a state that disproportionately experiences the impact of ocean debris with our thousands of miles of coastline. This historic accomplishment on #marinedebris is the result of so many people who love our oceans: members of Congress who span the country &amp; political spectrum, members of the administration, stakeholders in industry and environmental groups, and everyday citizens. #SaveOurSeas After two years of collaboration, hard work and advocacy, I am incredibly excited to announce that the #SaveOurSeas 2.0 Act, the most comprehensive #marinedebris bill ever to pass Congress, is now the law of the land! üåä

The briefing presented good information and some hopeful news that I wanted to share with all Alaskans. https://t.co/nZZ3KVNsGx In particular, he must assure us that these operational plans can be done without risking American lives and without leaving a power vacuum, which terrorist groups might fill.

More info: https://t.co/YVc7ZLiSiF https://t.co/BjIZSPH7Fq These fake emails, some sent to Alaskans, were clearly an attempt to foment distrust and hatred among our fellow citizens. While we may disagree with each other on policies, at the end of the day, we are all Americans. [3/3] Yesterday, I called on intelligence officials to quickly brief us in Congress on the extent of this intrusion and actions we can take to prevent it from happening again. These countries should know that there will be a cost.  [2/3] Iran &amp; Russia, as expected, are trying to undermine our democracy‚Äîone of our enduring strengths. These authoritarian governments do this to try to separate us and weaken our nation‚Äîand, unfortunately, for political gain, some are quick to play right into their hands. [1/3] https://t.co/O9iGHY1Sd9 The #PaycheckProtectionProgram has been a lifeline for Alaska small businesses. Today I voted to renew the program‚Äîmore relief funds for small businesses, workers &amp; our fishermen. Unfortunately, Senate Dems chose to oppose it, prolonging the pain &amp; hardship of many Alaskans. #PPP I‚Äôve been in touch w/ senior @FEMA &amp; State of Alaska officials about the tsunami warning along the Alaska Peninsula coast.

https://t.co/hfalDpgG0z The American Rescue Plan is already delivering for Montana families. With ramped up vaccination efforts and direct relief to folks in need, we're seeing lower unemployment and more money flowing into our economy‚Äîand it's just getting started.
https://t.co/m8lvcgonO3 These additional vaccines are great news for Montana veterans and their families‚Äîespecially those in rural areas. I'll continue working hard to ensure we're getting more vaccines into more Montana communities so we can get our economy back on track as soon as possible. https://t.co/TIvkdsBjH4 Under Postmaster DeJoy's failed leadership, @USPS has fallen behind on providing the kind of efficient mail service Montanans need. Today, I met with President Biden's picks to lead the Postal Service and made it absolutely clear that we need a reliable USPS for all Montanans. Protecting our public lands means protecting jobs and our Montana way of life. Today, I met with the @conservationall to discuss ways we can do just that, including the need to pass my Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Act and my Montana Headwaters Legacy Act.

Let's get it done. https://t.co/mPaPlFpHJr As Chairman of @SVACDems, I believe it's critical that we do more for vets suffering from toxic exposure. Glad to host advocate @jonstewart and FealGood Foundation founder John Feal today to discuss the importance of ensuring these vets get the care and benefits they've earned. https://t.co/2pShNvv6IT Too many Montanans have lost loved ones to COVID-19.

For more info, call 844-684-6333 or head to https://t.co/gllov8FM4k It was an honor to host Sec. @DenisMcDonough in Montana last week. As Chairman of @SVACDems, I look forward to working with @DeptVetAffairs to put these ideas into action so we can better live up to the promises we've made to those who have served our nation. 

Let‚Äôs get to work. We heard firsthand the need to expedite COVID-19  vaccinations and expand rural health care services, as well as the critical importance of better serving women and Native veterans, improving mental health care, and ensuring we‚Äôre delivering COVID-19 relief to those in need ASAP. https://t.co/IfGKwjkAj1 Each day we held a listening session with veterans, VA employees, Veterans Service Organizations, local health care providers, and others to discuss how we can improve @DeptVetAffairs services across Montana and across this nation. https://t.co/VZOQIINN8O At the new Southwest Montana Veterans Home in Butte, VA Secretary @DenisMcDonough and I had the chance to discuss directly with Montana veterans, veterans advocates, and community leaders how @DeptVetAffairs can better serve vets in rural America. https://t.co/qkHNl4ADIB We had the opportunity to tour the Yellowstone National Cemetery and pay tribute to Montana veterans before heading down to visit with folks at the Montana State University Veterans Center. https://t.co/xGYhCE1XGN We kicked off our listening tour by meeting with VA staff at the Veterans Clinic in Billings. These folks work hard every day to serve local Montana veterans. https://t.co/PhaadaDFU6 Last week, @DeptVetAffairs Secretary @DenisMcDonough and I had the chance to hear directly from Montana veterans how VA can better provide the care and benefits they need and earned.
 
ICYMI ‚Äî here's a look at our week ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/BkCncXuYtU Proud to see the POW/MIA flag is once again flying high above the White House, especially today on National Former POW Recognition Day. We will always honor the sacrifices of our brave servicemembers who were held behind enemy lines, and those who have not yet returned home. https://t.co/u1a4REVqlZ Glad to see @IHSgov Acting Director Elizabeth Fowler in Montana this week. 

Montana Tribes have done an outstanding job getting vaccines to folks safely and efficiently, ensuring we're getting closer each day to putting this pandemic behind us.
https://t.co/FvaBQwhCGn Every Montanan should have access to an affordable place to live. The #AmericanRescuePlan secured more than $15mil to construct, purchase, and rehabilitate homes so hard-working Montana families have the relief they need to put a roof over their heads and get back on their feet. Montana veterans swore an oath to this country and deserve high-quality care. VA Secretary @DenisMcDonough and I are joining Montana veterans at the MT Army National Guard HQ today to hear more on how @DeptVetAffairs can better deliver the benefits our veterans earned. https://t.co/9CKjmSzDeO If there‚Äôs one thing Montanans know, it‚Äôs good beer. Wishing a very happy #NationalBeerDay to folks across the Treasure State‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your favorite Montana brew? üçª To combat the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples crisis, we need resources directly focused on investigating these cases‚Äîand @SecDebHaaland knows it. Glad to see the formation of the new @USIndianAffairs' Missing &amp; Murdered Unit that will help keep Montana communities safe. Stopped by the newly-opened Southwest Montana Veterans Home today in Butte with @SecVetAffairs. I was honored to work alongside Butte community members to get this facility off the ground so more Montana veterans have access to the care they need. https://t.co/TwhM9dZ4gG The best way to know how the @DeptVetAffairs can better serve MT veterans is to hear directly from MT veterans. 

@SecVetAffairs and I are at @montanastate to meet with more Montanans and discuss how VA can better provide the high-quality care our veterans need and earned. https://t.co/GUGrdofDZ1 Deeply honored to visit the Yellowstone National Cemetery with @DeptVetAffairs Secretary @DenisMcDonough today and pay tribute to our veterans. 

The service of these brave Montanans will not be forgotten. https://t.co/XaJsLlZeCf Proud to celebrate the Treasure State through every season, but especially today. Grateful always to call Montana home‚Äîhappy #406Day!

üì∏: @NatlParkService https://t.co/Rg7nC6bAfC Sharla and I are sending our condolences to the friends and family of former Montana Governor Stan Stephens. From his days in radio all the way to the Governor‚Äôs mansion, Governor Stephens devoted his career to serving Montanans. Today, VA Sec @DenisMcDonough and I held a roundtable in Billings to talk directly with veterans, advocates, and community leaders about how the @DeptVetAffairs can better serve those who have served us. I look forward to working with the Secretary to put these ideas into action. https://t.co/7H4ZrB3xse I'm honored to host @DeptVetAffairs Secretary @DenisMcDonough's first trip to Montana. 

This week, we'll hear directly from veterans on how we can ensure we're living up to the promises we've made to our men and women in uniform, both in rural America and across this nation. https://t.co/8Cgmrm8Qa4 We'll be planting seeds instead of hiding eggs this year, but celebrating the season all the same.

Wishing a very Happy Easter to families across the Treasure State today. https://t.co/wQceYjhqyt Sharla and I are heartbroken to hear that Capitol Police Officer Billy Evans was killed in the line of duty today. We grieve for Officer Evans' family, loved ones, and colleagues, and we are praying for the recovery of the second injured officer. My thoughts are with the officers injured today defending the Capitol and their loved ones, and I will continue to monitor this situation closely. 

I am thankful every day for the heroism of the Capitol Police who work tirelessly to ensure the safety of all of us who work there. It‚Äôs planting season! Ringing in Spring the best way we know how: https://t.co/Vth6ylNpjj The goal is simple‚Äîget more COVID vaccines to more Montanans ASAP so we can get folks back to work and our economy back on track. 

Proud to work with the Administration to secure even more critical doses for the Treasure State.
https://t.co/TsRXpsWmMs We're seeing more and more Montanans vaccinated every day, putting our state closer and closer to economic recovery. 

In the meantime, however, the American Rescue Plan is getting places like Kalispell the relief necessary to keep our communities afloat.

The American Rescue Plan ramps up vaccine production and distribution, giving us the tools we need to get more shots to Montanans ASAP. https://t.co/m6oOjYHJ5q Thanks for having me, Maggie! Grateful for all the Kalispell community leaders that joined us today to discuss the American Rescue Plan. This bill ensures direct relief is heading to places like @KalispellBrew so you can keep brewing well into the future. https://t.co/xojIpXIbLS Today, I'll be in Kalispell with more Montana businesses, veterans, and health care workers to talk about how these critical resources will get us back on track. First stop: @KGEZ1. https://t.co/3oBmQvuWhD Glad to visit with Great Falls community leaders yesterday to discuss the American Rescue Plan and how its impacts will get more Montanans vaccinated, and put us on a path to economic recovery.
https://t.co/nYjzUbGHS0 Glad to join small business and community leaders at the Celtic Cowboy this afternoon to discuss how the COVID relief package targets resources directly to places like Great Falls. This bill gives Montana businesses like this one the boost they need to get through this crisis. https://t.co/aX65zjKrLp Proud to be awarded the 2020 Legislative Recognition Award‚ÄîI'll always fight to ensure our first responders and EMTs have the resources they need to continue serving our communities. It was great to be with you. Montana's first responders have been there every step of the way during this pandemic, helping us keep our communities healthy and safe. Honored to visit with the folks at Great Falls Emergency Services as they continue their work on the frontlines to keep us secure. https://t.co/j7wOxlcC3M As Chairman of @SVACDems, I'm committed to ensuring we're living up to the promises we've made to our veterans. Today‚Äîand everyday‚Äîwe honor the service and sacrifices of Vietnam vets across our nation, and reaffirm our commitment to ensuring they receive the care they've earned. https://t.co/JRnruUqLzn Passover is a time to celebrate the strength of the Jewish people and the power of new beginnings. Wishing the best to Montana families beginning their celebration tonight. This pandemic has hit every part of our state, so we've got to make sure every part of it gets critical relief. 

This week, I secured a commitment from @USTreasury to ensure these resources are going directly into MT communities, without anything getting skimmed off the top. https://t.co/lp0gk19sxp Montana's Community Health Centers have been front and center during this pandemic, working hard to folks safe. 

I'm proud to have secured more than $24 million in the COVID relief package to support MT CHCs, bolster vaccine efforts, and help our state get back on track ASAP. To ensure MT ranchers get a fair shake in the cattle market, we've got to put them first‚Äînot corporate packers.

That's why I'm reintroducing my bipartisan bill giving producers more power to negotiate prices, and decrease market reliance on packer-manipulated formula pricing. Each week, we're getting more and more Montanans vaccinated, which is the key to putting this pandemic behind us and getting folks back to work.

ICYMI: MT's vaccine supply is set to increase by 7k next week. Proud to work with the Admin to get this done. https://t.co/yeE4FwuUN4 Great news for Montana veterans and their families! My bipartisan SAVES LIVES Act was signed into law, giving veterans, spouses, and caregivers more access to COVID-19 vaccines and the protection they need from @DeptVetAffairs. https://t.co/QiVMFBDnVk Too many politicians in Washington wanted to sit on their hands and do nothing to help our state recover from this pandemic‚Äîbut that's not how we do things in MT. This bill provides the targeted resources we need to get back on track. 

Read my op-ed here:
https://t.co/yPUCM8GU8W The ACA was signed into law 11 years ago today. Because of it, more than 150,000 Montanans with a pre-existing condition can't be denied coverage, 7,000 young adults can stay on their parent's coverage, and the number of uninsured veterans has dropped by 40%.

That's a big deal. Grateful for the farmers, ranchers, and food suppliers across Montana and the U.S. that work hard every day to keep food on our tables. 

From our family farm to yours, happy #NationalAgDay https://t.co/5NhwTCNNbp Saddened to learn of yet another shooting in one of our communities. My heart breaks for the families of the victims of last night‚Äôs shooting and all the folks in Boulder whose lives have been touched by this violence. Montanans deserve to know who is paying for political advertising. That's why I'm reintroducing the SUN Act, to shine light on big dollar donors and bring more transparency to our campaign finance system. https://t.co/q0CNyCqgO8 Native Montana women have helped shape the history of our communities, our state, and our nation‚Äîand will continue to do so long into the future. Proud to celebrate #WomensHistoryMonth by joining my colleagues in honoring Native women for their essential contributions to the U.S. A look inside Helena‚Äôs VA vaccination center today. Glad to see more Montana veterans with access to these safe and effective vaccines‚ÄîI‚Äôll keep working to secure more doses so every Montanan can get their shot. https://t.co/b6uAJ5zA3b Providing our veterans with the care and benefits they've earned is a cost of war, plain and simple. And for our Vietnam vets still waiting on care related to their exposure to Agent Orange, time is running out. 

We must expedite these claims as soon as possible. https://t.co/PElxdcJeJk Corporations aren‚Äôt people. And my amendment overturning the disastrous Citizens United decision will ensure the Constitution says so, once and for all. #SunshineWeek Reliable broadband is the key to bringing folks back to rural America. That's why we need to ensure funding for broadband infrastructure is targeted to places that are actually lacking coverage, not waste taxpayer dollars on areas that are already connected. https://t.co/vLb9Hyd6ls It's #SunshineWeek! I'm working to shine light on our campaign finance system and increase transparency in our elections. First up‚ÄîI'm proud to cosponsor the #ForthePeopleAct. This bill will secure our elections and kick dark money out of politics. 

Let's get it passed. Great news! The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act passed the House! #VAWA contains vital tools to help address the MMIP crisis, and provides resources and assistance to survivors in need. 

Time to get this bill over the finish line in the Senate‚Äîwe can't wait. Glad to see @GlacierNPS fully open their doors once again! I'll keep working with the Blackfeet Tribe, @NatlParkService, and local health officials to ensure folks on the ground have the resources they need to stay safe.
https://t.co/tcw6ZRX9OE My heart goes out to the victims and their families of last night‚Äôs despicable acts. It‚Äôs no secret that hate crimes against Asian Americans have been on the rise‚Äîwe must stand together and denounce these acts in all their forms.

Happy St. Patrick‚Äôs Day!‚òòÔ∏è Many communities across rural America lack sufficient affordable and accessible housing. This problem has only become more clear during this pandemic as safe, consistent shelter is more important than ever. 

We must address Montana's housing needs and we must address them ASAP. https://t.co/lQxlnRCMBG I'm proud to be joined by the Mayors of Great Falls, Missoula, and Bozeman in our push to ensure Montana's local governments and businesses get the relief they need to bounce back from this economic crisis. 

Read their thoughts here: https://t.co/xa0TCOXgAM One-size-fits-all rules don't work in unique places like Montana. That's why I'm fighting back against a proposed regulation from the federal government that could significantly reduce funding for Montana cities and towns in need of critical support to get through this pandemic. https://t.co/UqyrS8V8da Climate change, public education, and public lands were all on the docket for Ms. DeVries' class today. It was great to visit with these outstanding Denton high schoolers and discuss the issues they care about most. https://t.co/nVLZ2O4lw9 Great news for Montana veterans‚Äîmore than 2,000 COVID vaccines will be available for vets and VA staff this week. I'm going to continue working with the Administration to ensure every Montanan can access these life-saving shots. History made! @Interior Sec. Haaland is the first Native cabinet secretary in U.S. history. I look forward to working with her to ensure we're protecting our public lands, creating good paying jobs, and upholding trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal nations. Just had a productive meeting with @DeptofDefense Under Secretary Nominee @ColinKahl. His experience and steady hand prove he's qualified to for the job, and will be ready to serve on day one. Don‚Äôt forget to #MaskUp! Vaccinated or not, continuing to wear a mask is one of the best ways to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect our communities. 

Wishing everyone a great weekend. https://t.co/XMCB68AEOf This pandemic has had significant impacts on mental health‚Äîespecially for students. The COVID relief package provides Montana schools targeted resources for mental health services and suicide prevention efforts.

Our kids deserve nothing less. https://t.co/hMHww0Urgv Montana parents, teachers, and students all agree‚Äîwe want our kids back in the classroom as soon as possible. 

Thanks to the COVID relief package, Montana schools will have the resources they need to ensure our students can resume full-time learning swiftly and safely. https://t.co/Fll4pD3E6L You can bet I'll be holding the federal government accountable to ensure this targeted relief gets into the hands of folks in need as swiftly as possible. 

Montanans can't wait. https://t.co/PpgnbQEZJj It's official‚Äî@POTUS has signed the COVID relief package into law. This bill gives us the targeted resources we need to get Montanans vaccinated, get our kids safely back in school, and get our economy back on track. 

Critical relief is on its way to the Treasure State. Glad to be joined by Great Falls Mayor Kelly, Sidney Mayor Norby, and RN @vicky_byrd to discuss the direct relief this bill provides folks across MT. Time to get this bill over the finish line so we can put this virus behind us and get folks back to work.
https://t.co/U2CLko3akc Happening soon: I'll be going live on Facebook at 3pm MT to answer your questions. 

Join the conversation here: https://t.co/S215HKxj00 PASSED! The House just approved the COVID relief package, putting us one step closer to getting vaccines to all Montanans, getting our kids safely back in school full-time, and getting our economy back on track. 

Next stop, @POTUS' desk for signature. There's still time to get your questions in before my live Q&amp;A this afternoon‚Äîpost them below. ‚¨áÔ∏è

Tune in on Facebook at 3pm MT‚ÄîI look forward to being with you. https://t.co/5TZ47eteDn The future is bright for these outstanding Montana students‚Äîcongratulations to Cascade's Georgia Balius and Plevna's Trinity Rieger on their acceptance to the Senate Youth Program. #MTProud https://t.co/aZIRj26U1z It‚Äôs #NationalMeatballDay. What‚Äôs your favorite recipe?
https://t.co/EDIp4qVE9X Glad for the chance to chat with Mr. Fox's 7th grade American History Class this afternoon. These young leaders are the real deal‚Äîthey quizzed me on how we're tackling the pandemic, climate change, and equality for all Americans. https://t.co/PHxAhFFze7 The gag rule preventing Title X grantees like @PPFA from providing potentially life-saving care to patients is still in place, and is hurting folks seeking care. 

This rule was wrong when it was enacted and it's still wrong now. I'm calling on the Administration to fix it. https://t.co/Bj2NeUWoG1 Join me tomorrow at 3pm MT on Facebook for a live Q&amp;A as I answer your questions and hear your feedback. But first, make sure to get those questions in! 

Submit them below ‚¨áÔ∏è Great news! The new Southwest Montana vets home opened its doors today after decades of hard work from folks in the community and state legislature. I‚Äôm honored to have worked with these folks until Butte got the funding it needed to get vets the care and services they‚Äôve earned. https://t.co/97CYfKI31u Getting online is absolutely critical for Montana students learning from home, but some folks still don't have a connection. The Senate-passed COVID relief package includes funding for Montana schools and libraries to distribute hotspots and laptops for students without internet. https://t.co/pQ4xmOgEqf Want to know how the COVID relief package passed in the Senate this weekend impacts you and your family?

I'm holding another live Q&amp;A to hear from you on Wednesday at 3pm MT - let's hear those questions now ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/mWwDHTy6qF Every Montanan that wants a vaccine will be able to get one, thanks to the Senate-passed COVID relief package. This package will put us on the path to getting folks back to work faster, fully reopening schools sooner, and reviving Montana‚Äôs economy as quickly as possible. https://t.co/o7yhIrZFN4 Montana women run businesses, fight for our freedom, serve our communities, mold the next generation of leaders, and so much more. Thank you for all you do to make Montana the Last Best Place. #InternationalWomensDay This weekend, the Senate passed a much-needed COVID relief package that will help get more Montanans vaccinated and our economy back on track. Have questions about what this bill means for you? I'll be going live on Facebook 3/10 at 3pm MT to discuss. 
Drop your questions below‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/8MuI7FK1m1 More good news‚Äîmy bill to restore the Empire Builder to full service and reinstate furloughed employees has passed the Senate. 

This commonsense legislation will help folks along Montana's Hi-Line stay connected and boost local economies. https://t.co/0sZZCtDG5Z As Chairman of @SVACDems, I'm proud to include critical resources for veterans in the COVID relief bill. This package ensures more vaccines will go to veterans, will remove copay burdens from veterans seeking care, and provide critical relief to veterans and their families. https://t.co/cOl1FBAyOq What's next? This bill will head back to the House and then onto the President's desk for signature. You can bet I'll be working to ensure the resources in this bill get to folks that need them as swiftly as possible, so we can put this virus behind us once and for all. I just voted YES on the much-needed COVID relief package. 

This targeted bill:
‚úì Helps ensure every Montanan who wants a vaccine can get one.
‚úì Provides direct relief to Montanans in need.
‚úì Will help get folks back to work and get our kids safely back in school full-time. https://t.co/RgehGRKe9r Find your nearest participating pharmacy and make an appointment at https://t.co/RdNQjpqY5S. Montana parents, teachers, and students all want to be safely back in the classroom ASAP. Now, we‚Äôre one step closer. 

Teachers and staff in pre-K-12 schools and childcare programs are now able to sign up to get a vaccine at participating pharmacies. https://t.co/negBinWUFO My number one priority is getting this virus under control so we can get our economy back on track. 

I'm going to keep pushing to ensure this legislation works for all Montanans so we can put this pandemic behind us, once and for all. This bill ensures any Montanan who wants a vaccine can get one.

This bill supports hard-hit small businesses.

This bill provides direct relief to Montana families.

This bill sends much-needed resources to state, local, and Tribal governments.

This bill meets this moment. I voted YES to proceed to a debate on the next COVID relief package, and here's why‚Äîthis targeted bill will help get all Montanans vaccinated, and will put us on the path to getting folks back to work, getting our kids back in schools full-time, and reviving our economy ASAP. Last night, the House passed the For The People Act. This critical legislation will help secure our elections and kick dark money out of politics. 

We need to get this bill through the Senate ASAP, and onto the President's desk for signature. Learn more about this bipartisan bill here: https://t.co/nOVVtrQyge Mom and pop restaurants are more than just places to grab a bite‚Äîthey're the places we make memories. But these small businesses have been hit hard by the pandemic. 

My bipartisan RESTAURANTS Act helps provide the relief they need to keep their doors open and food on the tables. https://t.co/ycBcLI6mBy Montana's live venues are standing by, ready to help distribute more vaccines to more Montanans. I'm calling on @POTUS' Coronavirus Task Force to utilize large event spaces to bolster vaccination efforts so we can get this pandemic behind us and get folks back to work. https://t.co/du13LsCIJY Another batch of vaccines are on their way to veterans and VA staff in Kalispell. Today, more than 500 folks will receive these critical doses, further protecting our communities and getting us closer to putting this pandemic behind us once and for all. Right to Work legislation is just plain wrong for Montana. These bills gut the ability of working folks to negotiate better wages, benefits, and working conditions. 

Montana's working families deserve better. https://t.co/iviD5M5qUt It's National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week! Montana's seven TCUs give students across Indian Country the tools they need to succeed. Proud to join educators, students, and parents in celebrating our TCUs and all the great work they do for Big Sky Country. Montana women have a long record of working to create brighter futures for us all. From Jeannette Rankin, to Elouise Cobell, to the folks continuing to break down barriers every day, we celebrate all you do to blaze the trail for the next generation.

Happy #WomensHistoryMonth! Friends that mask together, laugh together‚Äîand it‚Äôs always a laugh when @SenJackyRosen is around! 

Mask up folks! https://t.co/XYwHU2ubSd You had to be there. 

#FlatTopFriday https://t.co/zj8PhBhh6v Communities across Montana's Hi-Line rely on Amtrak's Empire Builder to boost their economies. The short-sighted decision to cut it's service and furlough employees was just plain wrong. 

My bill rights that wrong.
https://t.co/nj6ydwii5R Great news for Montana! Next week, our state's supply of vaccines will increase by more than 2k. Montana has proven that we have the capacity to get more shots into folks' arms‚ÄîI'll keep holding folks in Washington accountable until everyone has access to these critical doses. Great news‚Äîtoday, 300 more vaccines made their way to Butte to help protect veterans and VA staff from COVID-19. I'll be keeping up my push to get more vaccines to all Montanans, no matter who they are or where they live. I look forward to working with General Ray, the @usairforce, and the @DeptofDefense to ensure their mission continues to get the attention it needs. As Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I had the pleasure of speaking with General Timothy Ray from Air Force Global Strike Command today about our nation‚Äôs defense priorities. The House just passed the #EqualityAct, a bipartisan bill protecting LGBTQ+ folks from discrimination. The Senate should pass this bill immediately and send it to the President's desk for signature. There‚Äôs no time to waste‚Äîequality for our fellow Americans can't wait. Montanans are known for stepping up when times get tough. 

Grateful to all our health care professionals who continue to go above and beyond to ensure our communities are protected from COVID-19. #MTProud
https://t.co/P94wgOtRrN Postmaster DeJoy's short-sighted decisions are continuing to hurt Montanans that rely on the @USPS for their livelihood, and I'm holding him accountable. 

Montana's economy should not suffer just because USPS cannot guarantee timely deliveries.
https://t.co/4VBORarmgD Great to meet with elementary principals from across MT today. As a former teacher, I know just how critical your role is in serving our students during these challenging times, and I'll keep pushing for the resources you need to get all our kids back in the classroom safely. https://t.co/VLzqR0wkH6 Cutting the Empire Builder's service meant cutting good-paying jobs on the Hi-Line, and lowering revenue for Montana's frontier communities. That's unacceptable. 

My bill will help get our economy back on track by restoring Amtrak service and reinstating furloughed employees. The decision to cut the Empire Builder's service and furlough Montana Amtrak employees was a big mistake. 

My bill will fix that.
https://t.co/xkWzORFoEt A second round of COVID-19 vaccines is headed to Missoula today for more than 200 veterans and VA staff. I'll keep working with the Administration and folks on the ground to ensure we're getting more of these critical doses into every community across our state. That's right. I'm holding today's @SVACDems hearing to examine the @DeptVetAffairs‚Äô progress in vaccinating our veterans and discuss how we can get more critical doses to those who've served.

Watch live at 2pm MT ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/hn1p2PU51R https://t.co/lIsaV5TxxK Every American deserves equal protection under the law, no matter who they are or who they love. The Equality Act ensures LGBTQ+ folks are protected from discrimination. 

We need to pass it now. https://t.co/3gUqFYvoAu The climate crisis is just that‚Äîa crisis. And we've got to find solutions that work for everyone. From the Big Apple to Big Sandy, we can't afford to leave anybody behind. https://t.co/cyJ2imZK8e A strong public education system is the key to providing our kids with the tools they need to thrive. As a former public school teacher, I'm proud to celebrate our schools, teachers, administrators, and parents by leading my colleagues in designating 2/22-26 Public Schools Week. https://t.co/uVLcASbX7J This is a grim reminder that while the arrival of the vaccine brings with it the hope of a brighter future, we aren't out of the woods yet. Please continue mask up, social distance, and follow public health guidelines to help protect yourself and your communities. The devastating loss of 500,000 of our friends, neighbors, and family members to COVID-19 is being felt in every corner of this nation. Sharla and I offer our deepest condolences to the millions that have lost loved ones as we grieve the loss of our fellow Americans. Montana snow is no joke. Let me know if you ever get stuck ‚Äî always happy to help. https://t.co/JFtm8D54by I'm keeping up the push to get more vaccines to communities across Montana. Today, more than 500 veterans and VA staff in Bozeman will receive these critical doses. And I won't stop until all Montanans, no matter who they are or where they live, have access to a vaccine. ICYMI: I'm proud to be taking the gavel as the new Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Whether our servicemembers are on the ground, in the air, or at sea, I'll be fighting to ensure they've got the resources they need to keep us safe. https://t.co/UIyrbEDpn4 Our state has been among the best when it comes to getting the vaccines we've got into folks' arms‚Äîwe just need more shots. I'm urging the Biden Administration to ensure MT is getting our fair share of vaccines so we can protect our communities and get our economy back on track. https://t.co/W3ySRVfkwl In spite of the challenges posed by COVID-19, Montana remains the Last Best Place when it comes to starting and growing a small business. I'm continuing my fight to ensure MT businesses‚Äînew and old‚Äîhave the resources they need to get through this crisis. 
https://t.co/WurLXdSeQG The ACA marketplace is back open! Montanans in need of health coverage can head to https://t.co/c7GyBtWVwC now to find a plan that works for their families. #GetCovered today. I‚Äôm keeping up my push to get COVID vaccines into more Montana communities. This weekend, 500 more veterans and VA staff in Missoula will have access to these critical doses, helping to protect more Montanans from this virus. Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day to Sharla, with a tractor full of love. https://t.co/DyzwdA32Bn I took my duty to serve as an impartial juror seriously and listened to the evidence presented by the prosecution and defense.

My full statement on the conclusion of the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump: https://t.co/1VWxCBIoht Sharla and I are saddened to hear of the passing of Major Richard Star, an American hero who served and sacrificed for this country. His legacy will live on in our continued fight to ensure our men and women in uniform get the benefits and care they deserve. https://t.co/QPj7AKUQFH The Senate came together to unanimously pass my bill honoring Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman for his heroic actions on Jan 6th.

https://t.co/eFR22U54rh Officer Eugene Goodman didn't just help protect folks in the Capitol from a violent mob on Jan. 6th‚Äîhe helped protect our democracy. Proud that the Senate could come together and move to bestow this American hero with the highest honor in Congress, the Congressional Gold Medal. I‚Äôm honored to take the gavel as the new Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work for our servicemembers in Montana, across this country, and around the world https://t.co/RvAXAzew5V Nobody knows how to protect Montana lands better than Montanans. 

Glad to see @Interior answer my call to roll back regulations that would have undermined #LWCF so this fund can be used as intended‚Äîto work with folks on the ground to protect our public lands and outdoor economy. Yesterday's video evidence proved again what we already knew‚ÄîOfficer Eugene Goodman and our Capitol Police officers are American heroes. Grateful for their quick action on January 6th and all they do to keep us safe. I'll keep holding this Administration accountable to get more vaccines into communities as quickly and safely as possible. I'm continuing my push to ensure more vaccines are getting into the arms of all Montanans, including our veterans. Today, more than 600 vets and VA staff at Fort Harrison, in Miles City, and in Missoula will receive critical doses. Brrr! ü•∂ It‚Äôs -36 here on the farm in Big Sandy. Be sure to take care and stay safe out there, folks! - Sharla https://t.co/7mOFmpZSwC From their farms to our forks, Montana pulse producers help feed this nation. It was great to catch up with the American Pulse Association today‚ÄîI'll keep fighting to ensure you've got the resources necessary to continue helping families put food on their tables. https://t.co/UmIOQq9w70 Good news for more MT vets‚Äîa shipment of vaccines will help get 500 more Great Falls-area veterans and VA staff protected from COVID-19. As Chairman of @SVACDems, I'll keep fighting to ensure we're getting as many shots in as many veterans' arms as quickly and safely as possible. I look forward to working with @DenisMcDonough to deliver the timely, quality health care and benefits that our veterans need and earned. And I'll be holding him accountable to ensure @DeptVetAffairs is squarely focused on meeting the needs of veterans and their families. The leader of @DeptVetAffairs must understand that above all else, the well-being and safety of our veterans come first. 

@DenisMcDonough's exemplary commitment to public service and to those who have served show he's up to the task. I congratulate him on his confirmation. We need a smart, targeted COVID relief package that meets the needs of this moment‚Äîand that includes ensuring our veterans aren't left behind.

Hear my floor speech today on how we're delivering for veterans‚Äîand all Americans‚Äîduring this crisis. ‚¨áÔ∏è
https://t.co/FjLStElhqH Dark money groups have far too much power in our political system.

As Chairman of @SVACDems, I‚Äôll keep fighting as hard as I know how to get more vaccines into communities and into as many veterans‚Äô arms, as quickly as possible. https://t.co/rP9zpURyHn Going live to answer your questions and hear your feedback.

Finished up w/ meeting here at the White House‚ÄîI made sure @POTUS knows that when it comes to additional COVID relief deals, we must keep our veterans front of mind. We've got to ramp up vaccine distribution for vets and VA staff and get relief quickly to those that need it most. https://t.co/SAxLyzRyzY TODAY: 400 doses of the Moderna vaccine have arrived in Kalispell for MT veterans and VA staff. Proud to have worked with both the Administration and folks on the ground to secure this delivery and help ensure MT veterans are one step closer to being protected from COVID-19. Our country faces serious threats at home and abroad. @AliMayorkas is an experienced public servant who recognizes the critical mission of @DHSgov‚Äîto protect our nation from harm. I congratulate him on his confirmation and look forward to working w/ him to keep our nation secure. Congratulations to @PeteButtigieg on his confirmation to lead @USDOT.

That's why I'm reintroducing my bipartisan bill to free up interstate commerce, reduce the meat production bottleneck, and bring more products to dinner tables everywhere. In Wednesday's hearing, I laid out VA's most urgent challenge‚Äîto address COVID-19 and ensure vets are getting their fair share of vaccines. 

Simply put, this agency must save as many lives as possible.

Proud to join my colleagues in moving to award him with a Congressional Gold Medal‚Äîthe highest honor Congress can bestow. Montana's waterways are the best Mother Earth has to offer. If we do nothing to protect them, they will disappear.
https://t.co/syEdrKaAvJ Just had a good conversation with VA Acting Secretary Dat Tran, and thanked him for stepping into this important role. He shares my commitment to always do right by our nation‚Äôs veterans, and I look forward to working with him during this transition. Lloyd Austin brings a much-needed steady hand to the Pentagon as he takes on the role of Secretary of Defense. I congratulate him on his historic confirmation and look forward to working with him to strengthen our nation's security and deliver for our servicemembers. 48 years later and the law of the land remains as clear as ever‚Äîthe government has no place between a woman and her doctor. https://t.co/tvTxvkZc9T Thanks, @LateNightSeth.

That's why in addition to my amendment to #EndCitizensUnited, I'll be reintroducing both my Spotlight and SUN Acts, which work to shine a light on big money donations and make donor information more accessible. The disastrous Citizens United decision continues to ensure dark money has a corrosive influence on our politics. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll be reintroducing my amendment to #EndCitizensUnited, bring transparency to our elections, and declare corporations are not people‚Äîonce and for all. .@USDOT nominee @PeteButtigieg proved today that he understands the importance of taking care of folks in rural America and that he is prepared to do so.

Looking forward to his quick confirmation. https://t.co/uMJ90HxUwt Always a pleasure to be recognized alongside my friends @CoryBooker and @rosariodawson ‚Äúand others‚Äù https://t.co/47xZprs3m7 Today's ceremony was a good reminder that there is more that unites us than divides us.

"Thune, John",SenJohnThune,johnthune,South Dakota,South Dakota,Senator," Conditions at our southern border are dire ‚Äì Ds can't deny it, so they‚Äôre trying to hide it (by blocking press). Pres. Biden &amp; VP should find time to see it. Maybe then they'll make needed policy changes. 
Until they do, good efforts by @CBP are just band-aids on a cracked hull. https://t.co/XeXh4atuGL If Democrats want to make impactful infrastructure investments, how about resuming (already paid for) wall construction at the southern border? Let‚Äôs start there. I confess I had missed the part in the Constitution that said the Supreme Court is only legitimate if a majority of its members were nominated by a Democrat president ‚Äì or at least reliably deliver liberals‚Äô preferred outcomes. https://t.co/Wk3Ln1BZ2k Not sure the grands tune in every week to Chris Wallace and @FoxNewsSunday, but they were especially interested in this morning‚Äôs discussion on infrastructure. #futurevoters https://t.co/ibTOdsNr3a Just toured the new Ascent Innovation Center, which is expanding on the success of the incubator at @sdsmt. They're doing great work to foster the fantastic high-tech innovation &amp; entrepreneurship we're already seeing in Rapid.

It was also great to catch up with Wayne, a Rapid City resident, as he got his first dose of the vaccine. https://t.co/74enHHtpCL I was able to join the community in celebrating the groundbreaking at the Liberty Center today. This new addition near Ellsworth AFB will give our airmen, their families, &amp; the Box Elder community a new, world-class recreation facility. https://t.co/m0l3WVj7u1 On the fly to Rapid City, but had to make a quick stop in the ‚ÄúMagic City‚Äù, my hometown of Murdo.

The president can start by reinstating policies that worked and enforcing our border. Border resources are overwhelmed. The president can‚Äôt afford to wait or ignore this any longer.
https://t.co/i0MW0Nrsh8 It was heartening to see firsthand the impact of our efforts to help @St_FrancisHouse get this facility started. Hundreds, if not thousands of people, have been helped this past year because they were in their new, COVID-capable facility. https://t.co/mEqv4MjaRA Sat down with Madison Regional Health System CEO Tammy Miller in her office today for an update on their work to treat South Dakotans in the area.

Happy Easter from our family to yours. He is Risen! https://t.co/UUCTPljD0p Horrible to hear of this shameful attack at the Capitol. It‚Äôs absolutely heartbreaking to learn that a @CapitolPolice officer has been killed. Please join me in praying for both officers involved &amp; their families. So grateful to @CapitolPolice &amp; all law enforcement. Sat down with folks from @SchoolAdmSD to discuss issues impacting SD students &amp; teachers. Then got a tour of some recent additions to @HarrisburgHigh.

Mr. President, this is what an open border looks like ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/XxWWxTN1to Inspired by @St_FrancisHouse‚Äôs mission of moving people from homelessness to hope, which is especially poignant during this season of rebirth. I‚Äôm thankful to everyone I met today for their dedication to service and the welcoming tour. https://t.co/IThikzyZb4 Powerful footage exposing how smugglers/cartels are brazenly exploiting Biden‚Äôs policies to traffic vulnerable women &amp; children into our country at a profit of over $14 million/ dayüëáüèª. You can read about this crisis in the news, but you have to see it to comprehend the magnitude. https://t.co/SBAXBxMqEb Caught up with a group of ag producers in Newell today. Connections like these are key for helping me shape effective policy for South Dakota farmers and ranchers. I‚Äôm extremely thankful for their time and counsel. https://t.co/bJxv9jePB2 With leaders from Spearfish this afternoon to check in on businesses &amp; answer their questions. The local economy is booming, but they also echoed concerns I have about how Dem proposals will grow our debt. https://t.co/q0HWlae1ZT Great to catch up with folks in Sturgis today. Had a good discussion about rising health care premiums for SD‚Äôs small biz &amp; other issues. Thanks for all of the great questions and feedback. https://t.co/AFWDRKjB4E Lucky to be at Monument Health when Lance, a Sturgis local, was getting his first dose of the COVID vaccine. SD just announced that the vaccine-eligible age is dropping to 16 on Monday ‚Äì more proof we‚Äôre leading the nation. Info on SD vaccine sign up: https://t.co/oNXWYCRY4O https://t.co/wdiMQE5sdf Was briefed at Camp Rapid this morning on the fires in the Rapid City area. Teams are working day &amp; night to keep South Dakotans in the area safe. They‚Äôve done a great job in the past 24 hours getting fires under control. I‚Äôm extremely grateful for their tireless service to SD. https://t.co/5b4JUQSDPa As long as the Biden admin continues to implement policies that give the impression of an open, porous border, people are going to keep flooding into our country. https://t.co/bk07i84Dhy This ‚Äúelection contest‚Äù in the House is a perfect sneak preview of what Dems‚Äô big government takeover would do to our state-run election system. If Ds don‚Äôt like an election result, they‚Äôll use their scrawny majorities to tell voters to pound sand. Good @GOPLeader letterüëáüèª #HR1 https://t.co/W6YMquivtn Two more stops in North Sioux City today. First, I participated in an economic development roundtable w/ business &amp; community leaders. Then to @SterlingComp to tour the office &amp; chat with employees ‚Äì it's a great company &amp; a good example of how businesses thrive in South Dakota. https://t.co/d9llaiOJQL Thank you to folks at the North Sioux City VA Outpatient Clinic for giving me a tour of their facility. Great work on getting vaccines out to our veterans. It's invaluable for me to get these real-time updates from our health care workers on the ground. https://t.co/h8eI4ddqjo I‚Äôm always impressed with the informed &amp; thoughtful questions I get from SD students. Today, I answered questions from Dakota Valley High School students that ranged from transparency in big tech AI to national security to how my role as Republican Whip benefits SD. Great talk! https://t.co/lQlLN84a8l üëÄ¬†time stamp¬†2:28¬†‚Äì a @CBP officer explains the truth about the crisis at the southern border.¬†
https://t.co/lXBzkntMDb The administration isn‚Äôt blocking illegal border crossings, but they are blocking the press &amp; transparency on the crisis they created. They even told a U.S. Senator to delete photos. As the migrant surge grows, we need to reinstate secure border and asylum policies. https://t.co/rS7pVnahvF Spoke with the incident commander for an update on the Schroeder fire &amp; to offer any assistance I can. Was told our crews did a lot of great work yesterday &amp; are staying motivated as they continue to fight this awful fire. I can't thank them enough for their life-saving efforts. All South Dakotans in the West River area, please stay safe and follow guidance of first responders. As always, thank you to our firefighters for putting their own safety on the line to protect our communities. I'm keeping all those affected in my prayers. https://t.co/aOZUwGwqIT Had a candid convo at the SF Rotary today. One thing I discussed was the dangers I see w/ social media. Big tech's goal is to keep you on the platform, so they reinforce what you already believe. My bill requires big tech to tell you when your feed is being manipulated by AI. https://t.co/zb86bkubyF I was shocked by conditions at the border, but Pres. Biden knew this was coming. His admin was warned by @CBP &amp; other experts that axing successful policies like ‚Äústay in Mexico‚Äù would mean a border crossing surge. They went forward anyway &amp; now we have a humanitarian crisis. https://t.co/hFc2E4GEg1 Midnight on the Rio Grande ‚Äì visible lights from smugglers on the Mexican side of the border. Hearing stories that these smugglers are charging upwards of $6,000, much of which flows to drug cartels. https://t.co/wm3YQNPgqM Being told by CBP that Biden border crisis was totally avoidable if this admin had listened to the warnings of our border experts. Once again, they caved to their political left, and the result is a humanitarian and public safety emergency, which is worsening by the day. https://t.co/ugtEQezFlh Strong border security, enforcing immigration laws, stopping asylum abuse, and cracking down on the traffickers and cartels that prey on migrants are among the steps the administration should take to end the Biden border crisis. What I‚Äôm seeing on the border is harrowing: facilities are dangerously overcrowded, border patrol officers are overwhelmed &amp; under-supported, smugglers (often w/ties to drug cartels) are profiting massively, hundreds of scared kids are on their own. https://t.co/M9EtgxpJlh POTUS claimed that the filibuster has been ‚Äúabused in a gigantic way.‚Äù There have been *zero* filibusters this Congress. So he must be referring to last Congress? Or the one before that? Or the one before that? You know, during the 6 years when Dems filibustered GOP initiatives. It‚Äôs amazing that President Biden can still stand in front of the American people and talk about unity when he seems open to the idea of potentially cutting half the Senate out of the lawmaking process. President Biden talked an awful lot about ‚Äúcreating jobs‚Äù and the ‚Äúaverage American‚Äù for a person who took jobs away from over 10,000 Americans on his first day in office. #KeystoneXL .@USDA¬†is doing the right thing¬†&amp; moving forward with the additional CFAP assistance that Congress provided last year. I‚Äôll continue pressing USDA to assist¬†our¬†farmers, ranchers, and biofuel producers affected by the pandemic.¬†

We had a long discussion about the importance of being firm in your beliefs, while also having grace for those who may disagree with you ‚Äì all while standing under Honest Abe. What a cool moment to share. https://t.co/ULmUsu2j9a The Biden administration halfheartedly told migrants ‚Äúdon‚Äôt come,‚Äù but its relaxed, open-border policies say otherwise. The admin has dispatched FEMA, yet officials won‚Äôt acknowledge the very crisis they‚Äôre scrambling to contain. https://t.co/vgC7qdtFLO I‚Äôm going to the border tomorrow to see the conditions firsthand &amp; learn more about the growing humanitarian crisis that‚Äôs occurring. What‚Äôs the first bill Dems would likely pass if they break the Senate filibuster rule? A bill to federalize elections, restrict states‚Äô rights, &amp; eliminate protections for election integrity. https://t.co/XnUnymu0L2 A quick search of ‚Äúblocked‚Äù in my Twitter feed shows just how much Democrats loved the filibuster when the shoe was on the other foot.
Our GOP majority put principle above power. Dems want to change a 100+ year old rule so they can pass their far-left liberal wish list. https://t.co/jJj2UQVJbx Dems loved the filibuster when they were in the minority, &amp; it meant they could have a say in GOP bills. But just a few months into their new majority &amp; they don‚Äôt want to bother w/ bipartisanship. They want to do whatever they want, whenever they want it. https://t.co/JR0cKbhTQQ Absolutely true. Americans see through their antics. Democrats are abandoning what‚Äôs right for a shortsighted power grab, &amp; the policies they could force through would be disastrous. https://t.co/UeLWipYebM Every ear of corn, loaf of bread, or cut of steak you buy at the grocery store is the result of the tireless work of farmers &amp; ranchers. Our producers wake up with the sun, work through storms, &amp; hardly know vacation so they can feed the world. #AgDay21 https://t.co/TZxyHtlCp1 Ready to see some more üî• basketball from these stellar athletes. You‚Äôve got this! #GoYotes üèÄ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è https://t.co/IGga5IsP3q Our immigration system at the southern border is cracking at the seams. We‚Äôre seeing 20-year record highs in people trying to cross the border because of this admin‚Äôs actions. That's only going to get worse unless we see a real change in tone &amp; policy from the President. Good luck in the big game today @GoJacksWBB üèÄ. The state is in your corner! Just another Friday night hanging out with the üêê. https://t.co/fkN134zB7j Had a hopeful talk with folks from the Indian Health Service, Primrose Retirement, Aberdeen Public Schools, NSU, and Avera about the progress made toward returning to normalcy. https://t.co/93yLi3qqzu The vaccine rollout is looking good in South Dakota. I‚Äôm in Aberdeen today speaking with experts &amp; health care workers. First stop was the VA Community Outpatient Clinic where I was lucky enough to see some American heroes get the vaccine. Then on to @SanfordHealth. Great job! https://t.co/f2yclVkP8I #2A news: In a win¬†for South Dakota gun owners, @ATFHQ has determined SD‚Äôs Regular Concealed Carry Permit process qualifies as an alternative to NICS, cutting unnecessary red tape.¬†More¬†-&gt;
https://t.co/IChT1ZW03x Gym memberships &amp; other tools for an active lifestyle are a key part of staying healthy &amp; preventing devastating, expensive illnesses down the road. Americans should be able to invest in their health using tax-free dollars from their FSA &amp; HSA ‚Äì that‚Äôs what my bill does. #PHITact Announced a common-sense #bipartisan bill this week that will help Americans invest in their health today to avoid a massive medical bill tomorrow. This bill is a win-win, helping Americans stay active &amp; healthy, while also helping lower health care costs down the road. #PHITact https://t.co/FK6NWAyNab Not sure how confident I‚Äôm feeling this year.

#MarchMadness https://t.co/FQfQGANkHX Beyond being a lawyer with next-to-zero health care experience, Xavier Becerra is a threat to religious liberty. He is the wrong person to lead any health department ‚Äî let alone¬†@HHSgov during a pandemic. Last March, a few of my colleagues &amp; I had a friendly pickup game ‚Äì not knowing that days later the world would be turned upside down by a pandemic &amp; #MarchMadness canceled. Now, it‚Äôs back on ‚Äì a hopeful sign.
Let‚Äôs go @SDCoyotesWBB &amp; @GoJacksWBB! We‚Äôre rooting for you! https://t.co/epoHK5MJOe Right now, Big Tech isn‚Äôt held accountable for actions to suppress or promote online content. They have power over what information millions of Americans see. I announced a bill to reform Section 230 protections &amp; expose Big Tech bias by requiring transparency &amp; due process. https://t.co/KaCVlWop8a And the correct answer is *President Biden* when he was in the Senate. Wild hypocrisy, right? https://t.co/oUPCHDj8OJ There‚Äôs a big bias problem in big tech. I have a bipartisan bill on the books that would go a long way toward making social media platforms more accountable to Americans and increasing transparency around what content they suppress or promote. https://t.co/KGCeEPbhxF Social media companies need to be extremely transparent about any content they hide, suppress, or promote, and establish due process for users whose content they remove. The millions of Americans who use their platforms deserve that. ‚ÄúThis nuclear option is ultimately an example of the arrogance of power. It is a fundamental power grab by the majority party ‚Ä¶ at its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee or a bill, it is about compromise and moderation.‚Äù

Take a guess who said this? This is very concerning. Farmers &amp; ranchers rely on foreign markets to buy their products. The @FMC_gov must get to the bottom of reports that certain ocean carriers are refusing to carry some agriculture products from U.S. ports back to Asia. My letterüëáüèª https://t.co/a2ULfw2ICp https://t.co/3DzBhIikYC Day one in office, President Biden suspended border wall construction that had already been funded by Congress. Beyond being a catalyst for the crisis we‚Äôre now seeing, it infringes on Congress‚Äôs constitutional power of the purse. https://t.co/cTkxqY3WEE Halting¬†border wall¬†construction, reducing enforcement, pausing deportations¬†‚Äì¬†Biden sent the message loud &amp; clear that¬†our border is open. Now¬†we‚Äôre seeing a¬†predictable¬†crisis of Dems‚Äô¬†own making, on pace to break 20-year records. The completely avoidable crisis at the border is the predictable result when you relax enforcement, halt border wall construction, pause deportations &amp; increase admissions. Plainly put, this situation is directly caused by this admin‚Äôs words &amp; actions. We can‚Äôt have open borders. https://t.co/iWVQZTqymV Was on with @hughhewitt this AM to talk about some of the key problems with the Dems‚Äô 1.9 trillion so-called ‚ÄúCOVID relief‚Äù bill signed by Biden last week. https://t.co/9QlfEdCG0O President Biden called for unity and bipartisanship, yet at this early point in his presidency, he‚Äôs already signed twice as many go-it-alone executive orders than any of his modern predecessors. A big part of bipartisanship is actually working with the other party ‚Ä¶ On their first major bill with new majorities in Congress, Democrats intentionally used a procedure to circumvent Republican support (and a bipartisan compromise). The American people didn‚Äôt sign up for a one-party, go-it-alone strategy. Federal funds shouldn‚Äôt be spent to violate the privacy of Americans. I‚Äôm supporting a bill to help defend against firearm registries &amp; gun owner databases that could violate the privacy of law-abiding citizens exercising their clear 2nd Amendment rights. https://t.co/Qax9s0O9hc 51 days into his presidency, and aside from a job waiver for one of his cabinet secretaries, 100 percent of the bills Joe Biden has signed into law have been entirely partisan. Dems promised that ‚Äúthings would change in the Senate"" if they got the majority. Now it's clear what they meant: the rise of ruthless partisanship &amp; silencing the minority. Under GOP leadership, we passed 5 *BIPARTISAN* COVID relief bills. Dems didn‚Äôt even try for bipartisanship. Not sure how bad Biden‚Äôs pick to lead the federal health department would be for America? I laid it out plainly last week with @SenTomCottonüëáüèª
https://t.co/G7WMTr2azL Xavier Becerra is an extremist who‚Äôs used the power of public office to advance an aggressively pro-abortion agenda and target religious liberty. I‚Äôll be voting against his nomination to head @HHSgov and would hope all 99 other senators do the same. https://t.co/MEAcnA5rok House just passed Dems‚Äô absurdly expensive ‚ÄúCOVID relief"" bill. Wait until Americans see what‚Äôs really in the bill:
-Blue-state bailouts
-Checks to illegal immigrants &amp; prisoners
-Huge welfare state expansion
-Post-pandemic spending
+ more goodies for special interest groups https://t.co/ETuTnAfW85 This important step continues to back up the @usairforce‚Äôs original base sequencing, and it paves the way for a final record of decision that would allow for significant construction to begin ahead of the B-21s‚Äô arrival. Dems rejected these GOP amendments &amp; many more. For over 11 hrs, Republicans fought to improve this bill - Dems blocked everything.

Dems did make some of their own changes:

Encourage Americans to stay unemployed by making unemployment benefits tax-free.
‚úÖ Approved by Dems Address President Biden‚Äôs unscientific decision to cancel the #KeystoneXL pipeline, stripping 10,000+ Americans of their jobs. 
‚ùå Rejected by Dems Require greater transparency on nursing home COVID-19 deaths. 
‚ùå Rejected by Dems 
(presumably in an attempt to protect Gov. Cuomo who‚Äôs under fire for falsifying nursing home data) Stop labor unions from taking COVID relief loan money intended for American small businesses.
‚ùå Rejected by Dems Support non-public schools that have gone above and beyond to get kids into the classroom where they can learn properly in-person.
‚ùå Rejected by Dems Encourage schools to get kids back in the classroom by tying extra funding to schools reopening (a change completely in line with the advice of experts who‚Äôve said again &amp; again that kids need to get back to school).
‚ùå Rejected by Dems Protect Americans from having their tax dollars used to pay for abortions.
‚ùå Rejected by Dems The $1.9 trillion bill being billed by Dems as ""COVID relief"" is a bad bill. Sadly, it will likely become law ‚Äì without any meaningful input/support from Republicans or the millions of Americans we represent. @SenateGOP even tried to improve the bill. Some changes Dems rejected: It was a bumpy road for Democrats to get their $1.9 trillion bill through the Senate. It turns out that when you force through a massive bill w/o committee review or any meaningful input from the Senate as a whole, you start to lose support, even from members of your own party. https://t.co/9wBLvCktVJ Important News üö®: The Final B-21 Environmental Impact Statement is complete, a key milestone as the Air Force vets Ellsworth AFB as the preferred location to host the training and first operations of the B-21 Raider. https://t.co/qNZm950wwD To be clear, Dems didn‚Äôt even try to make their $1.9 trillion bill bipartisan. @SenateGOP was more than willing to work w/ Dems ‚Äì as we have on *all* the other COVID bills (passed under a GOP majority). Now Dems have the reins &amp; they aren't interested in bipartisanship. The #DeathTax is an unfair tax that burdens family farms &amp; ranches. Tragedy &amp; loss shouldn‚Äôt be exploited to fill the federal government's coffers. Today, I led colleagues, including @LeaderMcConnell, @MikeCrapo, &amp; many more, to reintro a #DeathTaxRepeal. Congrats to @SDCoyotesWBB for punching a ticket to the NCAA Tourney! We‚Äôre excited to watch you make some noise at the big dance. #GoYotes From the time my daughters were little, I‚Äôve proudly watched them grow into confident young women through the help of sports. We should all want women to have a fair and equal playing field to continue to compete at the highest levels. https://t.co/jifzGgPIA9 Senator Blunt has been a staunch advocate for Missouri. Throughout his career, he's stood up for the conservative ideals we share: limited govt., free markets, low taxes, &amp; strong First Amendment rights. I know he‚Äôll ‚Äúfinish strong,‚Äù &amp; when the time comes, he'll surely be missed. https://t.co/JaZeSyXSGe Perfect day for a run or just about anything else. Wish I could say this is a typical SD Sunday afternoon in early March. #moreofthis https://t.co/dtpfIXOlNB Senate Democrats just managed to pass their bloated spending bill disguised as ‚ÄòCOVID relief.‚Äô This is the first COVID bill to be entirely partisan because it isn‚Äôt designed to help end the pandemic ‚Äì it's a blatant attempt from Dems to jam through a partisan wish list. This boondoggle of a bill is a case study in the pitfalls of pure partisanship. Democrats set the record for the longest recorded vote in modern history because it wasn‚Äôt ready for primetime. The last 24 hrs defined by chaos, arm twisting, wasteful spending, &amp; a #LiberalWishList. Democrats want Americans to believe that the bill they‚Äôre rushing through the Senate today is for coronavirus relief, but the truth is that less than¬†10% of the bill goes directly toward combating¬†COVID19. The other 90%? It‚Äôs not hard to guess ‚Äì just think ‚Äúliberal wish list.‚Äù https://t.co/5c3PvYPhiG For weeks, I‚Äôve been talking about how doubling the minimum wage could potentially hurt businesses, and the NY/DC press has attacked me for it every step of the way. Today, EIGHT DEMOCRATS voted against @SenSanders‚Äô proposal. Why? Because it‚Äôs bad policy. https://t.co/KAgDrLiHuB Congress has already passed the largest spending bill in history to combat COVID. Much of that spending was necessary to help Americans through it &amp; support our economy in the long term. But we don't need to spend $1.9 trillion MORE ‚Äì it‚Äôs downright irresponsible. https://t.co/EzRM4VllNi Pres. Biden canceled #KeystoneXL on day 1, but seems fine with Russia‚Äôs #NordStream2 pipeline. Congress &amp; the law are clear on sanctions authority‚Äîit‚Äôs time to act. Nord Stream 2 will make Europe more vulnerable to Russia‚Äôs influence &amp; will be an economic blow to Ukraine. https://t.co/6iJl1RK4hq The GOP-led Senate passed five BIPARTISAN bills to help Americans through COVID. Now that Dems have a razor-thin majority, they're jamming through a wasteful, self-proclaimed ""progressive,"" completely partisan bill with ZERO bipartisan support. Where's the unity, President Biden? https://t.co/AbJjXXV0ie The breakdown that Democrats don‚Äôt want Americans to see: 90% of this bill spends borrowed taxpayer dollars on items that aren‚Äôt directly related to combating COVID. Just 1% to help get the vaccine to Americans. https://t.co/YWTWrq2uWR ‚ÄúIndeed, something has gone seriously awry in California when its attorney general spends his time attacking, instead of defending, Americans‚Äô freedom of speech and religious liberty.‚Äù
More from me and @SenTomCotton on Biden's unqualified @HHSGov nominee, Xavier Becerra.üëáüèª https://t.co/PklqCD7rGa In a pandemic, you‚Äôd think @POTUS would pick an HHS nominee w/ a public health background, but Xavier Becerra is a lawyer whose most notable health care experience was fighting nuns in court over their federally granted contraceptive mandate exemption.  https://t.co/G7WMTr2azL If Democrats want to ram through a massive spending bill to fulfill a slew of liberal wish list items, then they should at least call it what it is, not mislead Americans by calling it a ‚ÄúCOVID relief‚Äù bill.
You know their motto, though: Never allow a crisis go to waste. https://t.co/MdbcHQaank You NYC/DC economic wizards can raise the minimum wage as high as you want for your residents. With a growing economy and an unemployment rate of 3 percent, South Dakota doesn‚Äôt need your advice or bad economic policy. Once again, the NY/DC media shows how out of touch they are with the real world. It took 5 years for me to work my way up to cook. The point is there were jobs available. With a $15 min wage, for small-town businesses in the hard-hit travel industry, there won‚Äôt be. https://t.co/m2zzC20iw1 Encouraging to see other countries increase use of biofuels to lower emissions, now with the UK adopting E10 this fall, up from E5. Ethanol exports from üá∫üá∏ to üá¨üáß will further strengthen our special relationship.¬†
https://t.co/oISfIktCl7 If Dems have shown the American people anything since taking their thin majority, it‚Äôs that they're happy to take advantage of a crisis to force through their agenda w/ no bipartisan support. Spending won‚Äôt stop here. This is their 1st major bill. Imagine what‚Äôs down the road. Today I pushed the @USTradeRep nominee to support mandatory country of origin labeling, expand market access, and enforce existing trade agreements. I will keep fighting for South Dakotans and a pro-growth trade policy that benefits American workers and businesses. https://t.co/hQW5NxWfey Biden again asked what to cut from Dems‚Äô giant spending bill. I offered some ideas on Tuesday, but here they are again:
-$350B state/local slush fund
-$86B bailout of multiemployer pensions
-Post-pandemic $$ Congrats! Good to have you back advocating for producers. Let‚Äôs get to work on the priorities we‚Äôve discussed for South Dakota‚Äôs farmers &amp; ranchers (resuming CFAP, cattle market integrity, SHIPP, cover crop flexibility, &amp; promoting clean biofuels). https://t.co/ARAgjQhWaz Iran has repeatedly proven that it can‚Äôt be trusted. Biden must stand against Iran‚Äôs destabilizing activities/state sponsorship of terror, not grant sanctions relief that funds their malign agenda (&amp; not repeat mistakes of Obama‚Äôs terrible nuclear deal).
https://t.co/UG6gtm6o3b Had the chance to meet with folks from the @SDRuralWater today to discuss ways we can continue to advocate for funding to improve water infrastructure across the state. https://t.co/iFMhOgM5F5 COVID challenged our nation‚Äôs food supply chain &amp; highlighted vulnerabilities. Viable processing facilities are few &amp; far between, making it hard for ranchers to get meat to consumers. I just reintro‚Äôd my Strengthening Local Processing Act to help improve access to processing. I started working by bussing tables at the Star Family Restaurant for $1/hour &amp; slowly moved up to cook ‚Äì the big leagues for a kid like me‚Äì to earn $6/hour. Businesses in small towns survive on narrow margins. Mandating a $15 minimum wage would put many of them out of business. https://t.co/izQDOGRAH1 Less than 10% of the $1.9 trillion partisan ‚ÄúCOVID relief‚Äù bill Democrats are pushing goes directly to combatting #COVID19. Yes, less than TEN percent. 

Makes you wonder where the other 90% of taxpayer dollars will be spent ‚Ä¶ Can anybody say ‚Äúliberal wish list‚Äù? Make no mistake ‚Äì the partisan spending bill that Dems are pushing through Congress is not about helping the American people through this health crisis. 90% of the money they‚Äôre spending isn‚Äôt directly related to combating COVID. Democrats are using a pandemic for political gain. https://t.co/SO22e5y7HK A lot of jargon here, but this is a very important step toward getting the power of 5G technology in Americans‚Äô pockets. My MOBILE NOW Act directed the @FCC to work with @NTIAgov to make more spectrum available for 5G for this reason. https://t.co/hHuot6WWDm Non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says that 95% of the money allocated to schools in the Democrats‚Äò $1.9 trillion partisan spending bill wouldn‚Äôt be given to schools until 2022-2028. Hardly seems like you can call that ‚Äúemergency funding.‚Äù The so-called ""COVID relief"" bill (only 10% goes directly to COVID) being pushed through Congress by Dems would raise the minimum wage to $15/hour in all 50 states. This is BAD policy that will cost Americans 1.4 million jobs. Dems must stop pushing these job-killing policies. https://t.co/lMcGznZC6C There isn‚Äôt a better place to celebrate the 4th of July than Mt. Rushmore.

Enjoyed meeting with @SDState senior leadership to catch up on what‚Äôs going on at the university. #GoJacks https://t.co/dTe6NlpGpg In the last National Defense Authorization Act, Congress required the Air Force to keep in place all maintenance personnel at B-1 bases. The additional resources will not only support the B-1 mission, but means that the force structure is already in place to maintain B-21s. Ellsworth has retired its first B-1 bomber as the USAF prepares for the B-21 Raider. The retirements (some to recallable storage) will permit additional maintenance for remaining ‚ÄúBones‚Äù to preserve a high rate of combat readiness until the B-21 arrives. https://t.co/xy1THkgLJg And of course, no stop in Vermillion is complete without checking out some @SDCoyotesMBB hoops. These guys look poised to make a strong run at the Summit in a few weeks. https://t.co/IcbvFcRVQM Had the opportunity to speak to @usd‚Äôs Advanced Leadership and Practice class this afternoon.

Pretty cool to see SD‚Äôs¬†@Daktronics¬†light up the Tampa sky. #SuperBowlLV .@TomBrady and @PatrickMahomes may have some cannons, but @AFGSC is bringing the real long-range strike to #SuperBowlLV. Special to see the men and women of South Dakota's Ellsworth AFB represented in the historic

What about these Americans whose jobs &amp; businesses have been flattened by his executive orders?
It‚Äôs not enough to talk about unity. It has to be matched with action. https://t.co/HvoUtCcC6u Now is the time for President Biden to live up to his pledge to unify our nation. Not just talk ‚Äì action. He could start by urging congressional Dems to actually negotiate w/ GOP, instead of trying to force through a leftist agenda. https://t.co/DnoM7vo1wm If Democrats are going to push through more COVID relief on a partisan basis, they should include my fix that would protect health care workers &amp; those working remotely from surprise tax bills. https://t.co/bH57a3jBx2 I‚Äôm focused on making policies that create good-paying jobs. I just announced a bipartisan bill that would help workers get the skills they need to succeed in telecom jobs &amp; also help address workforce shortages that could hinder deployment of #5G &amp; rural broadband ‚Äì a win-win. https://t.co/UtdzPRdRaz These are the real people, out by my hometown of Murdo, who are behind the jobs gutted by canceling the Keystone XL pipeline.

Big things on the way for @Vol_Football! Sens. Sinema &amp; Manchin are standing by principle. Minority protections (which Dems used for years under a GOP majority) are a vital part of the Senate. Ending the filibuster would make it easier to pass their radical-left agenda but would come at a great cost to bipartisanship. https://t.co/zzlLg5gSsw Right.

The¬†@SenateGOP¬†majority had many opportunities to strip filibuster power from Democrats, but ‚Äì despite pressure from many &amp; frustration for ourselves ‚Äì we protected the filibuster because we respect the U.S. Senate.

Disappointing to see the new admin jump at the first opportunity to eliminate a project that provides high-paying jobs to 11,000 Americans &amp; bolsters energy security.

https://t.co/C8cb9BQ25T While I am disappointed that my Democratic colleagues played politics with Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs nomination, I am excited for her confirmation this week. She will make an outstanding Justice. 

https://t.co/PRrtdHyk1w Thank you, @Mike_Pence, for joining @TeamTillis in the great state of North Carolina! We‚Äôre about to win on November 3rd -- because North Carolinians are fired up about another 4 YEARS of results! https://t.co/ZQnNnQ7jQA Cal Cunningham thinks he can run out the clock on this election, but North Carolina voters are smart and they recognize a fraud when they see one. https://t.co/GGZXbExmZv Veterans are speaking out against Cal Cunningham, whose misconduct could have him facing a court-martial. https://t.co/xcowLOzdIb North Carolinians don‚Äôt deserve to have a Senator who could face a court-martial.

https://t.co/4MiV6z0r1p Cal Cunningham is trying to run out the clock on his lies that landed him a US Army investigation, but North Carolinians are seeing right through him. 

This is coverage from just one day. https://t.co/Jo7VjDq4qp If Cal Cunningham can‚Äôt answer tough questions ‚Äì how can he be expected to make tough votes?

He is not fit for any elected office, let alone the United States Senate. https://t.co/t7WxO7Wr65 Go vote: find your polling place at https://t.co/h3nsttUKvU. We are 10 DAYS AWAY from Election Day, and early voting is well underway.

Your vote counts and could be the difference between holding the Senate or giving radical liberals the majority that they need to defund the police and implement crippling middle-class tax increases. https://t.co/tiWYE1p4ao North Carolinians deserve to know if they could be casting their vote for someone who could end up facing a court-martial. 

Cal Cunningham should explain himself. What else is he hiding? https://t.co/W5iTIihm05 North Carolinians are smart. They know a fraud when they see one, and Cal Cunningham can‚Äôt run the clock out on his lies and hypocrisy that got him under investigation by the US Army. https://t.co/zfF3EEOj1U North Carolina veterans are disgusted by Cal Cunningham‚Äôs misconduct.

https://t.co/SwsLwqOevL Cal Cunningham spent this entire campaign pitching himself as someone who will always run into the fight, but now he‚Äôs gone AWOL in order to avoid taking responsibility for his lies and misconduct. 

I will never go AWOL on the needs of North Carolinians. https://t.co/jDnUnAjFq6 The American people, after watching Judge Barrett‚Äôs hearings &amp; learning of her qualifications and Constitutionalist philosophy, are standing with her. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs even more disappointing that my Democratic colleagues are boycotting her nomination, all in the name of politics. https://t.co/zO2lzYXs2g I believe that Amy Coney Barrett will go down as one of the most qualified, well-regarded Justices in American history. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs all the more disappointing that my Democratic colleagues are playing politics with her confirmation.

https://t.co/mWQteylMMK ""I think it's less about the affair, and I do feel bad for his wife and his teenage children, it's more about the fact that this completely undermines Cal Cunningham's campaign of truth and honor,"" Tillis said.

https://t.co/PBPG1VUzIj I just voted to advance Judge Amy Coney Barrett out of the Judiciary Committee. She will make for an outstanding Justice, and I look forward to supporting her final confirmation. https://t.co/s6yXd5HQlp ""Cal Cunningham has run on honor, integrity, values, he‚Äôs put his family in the center in his campaign. And it‚Äôs all a lie."" https://t.co/5GKzWNFfpA While Democrats play partisan politics, I'm looking forward to voting Amy Coney Barrett out of the Judiciary Committee tomorrow. 

She is going to make an outstanding Supreme Court Justice.

https://t.co/JrqPD2BECH ""North Carolina Democrat Senate candidate Cal Cunningham denied six different interview requests on Tuesday amid fallout from his scandalous affairs.""

https://t.co/PBPG1VUzIj Cal Cunningham ran his campaign on truth and honor, but the real Cal Cunningham is being exposed for North Carolinians to see: he is facing an investigation by the Army and potentially by the FEC and the Inspector General of the DoD.

https://t.co/m05NZ7C7yQ Cal Cunningham attempted to make transparency and truth telling central pillars of his candidacy, but now he's gone AWOL because he doesn't want to talk about being under investigation by the U.S. Army and his possible court-martial. https://t.co/yE11wV1hCy Cal Cunningham ran a campaign on truth and honor, but the real Cal Cunningham is being exposed for all to see: he is facing an investigation by the Army and could potentially face a court-martial. https://t.co/JrMhE1UjLM Cal Cunningham would join radical Democrats in packing the Supreme Court, so that they can advance their liberal agenda from the bench.

But not on my watch.

My bill ensures that we keep precedent and keep the court at NINE Justices ‚Äì where it‚Äôs been for the past 150 years. https://t.co/CQL9AnGzjI Veterans know we can‚Äôt trust Cal Cunningham.

 And North Carolina can‚Äôt trust Cal Cunningham in the Senate. https://t.co/1x78KLcfvQ Cal Cunningham‚Äôs refusal to deny reports about a second affair serves as confirmation of both his egregious misconduct, but also his lack of fitness to serve you honorably and with integrity.

https://t.co/m05NZ7C7yQ North Carolinians deserve a Senator who is accessible and accountable, not one that goes AWOL when times get tough.

‚ÄúWe were not given a chance to ask questions, and the campaign has not responded to specific questions we‚Äôve asked in recent days.‚Äù https://t.co/XU8LCy4M5J Cal Cunningham is in hiding when it comes to who he wants on the Supreme Court instead of Amy Coney Barrett. Just like he's hiding from talking about his two extramarital affairs, including one with the wife of a veteran that has him under investigation by the U.S. Army. My full statement on Cal Cunningham refusing to deny a new report that he had a second, additional extramarital affair: https://t.co/eo1Ba75NIu Veterans know we can‚Äôt trust Cal Cunningham.

And North Carolina can‚Äôt trust Cal Cunningham in the Senate.

See our latest TV ad here: https://t.co/Xw5jg093Gb Early voting is underway! 

North Carolinians deserve a Senator who you and your families can trust ‚Äì because our economy and our public safety is on the line.

Make a plan to vote, and find your polling location at https://t.co/h3nsttUKvU. https://t.co/XJ5Kz8RP6P Even Cal Cunningham‚Äôs closest Democratic allies have had it with his lies, hypocrisy and misconduct. 

https://t.co/CerZuOIyJH Cal Cunningham violated his oath and betrayed the US Army when he committed his misconduct.

Now, North Carolina veterans are speaking out.

https://t.co/SwsLwqOevL ‚ÄúHis conduct is not a private matter if the Army is investigating it; it is a public disgrace of the Army‚Äôs uniform.‚Äù

https://t.co/Fco82N5WnI Cal Cunningham broke his oath and disgraced the U.S. Army. Veterans can‚Äôt trust him. And neither should all North Carolinians.

https://t.co/A5qoajZpJo Cal Cunningham‚Äôs campaign has all been one big lie. https://t.co/Q8A71VXN5I The US Army Reserve has opened an investigation into Cal Cunningham‚Äôs misconduct.

And now, the Inspector General of the Dep. of Defense, as well as the Federal Election Commission, have received complaints about Cunningham‚Äôs misconduct, too.

North Carolinians deserve answers. While Cal Cunningham is hiding from the voters to avoid taking tough questions about his misconduct, this weekend I heard from voters in Forsyth &amp; Guilford.

They are concerned about America‚Äôs future with Joe Biden &amp; Cal Cunningham, &amp; they‚Äôre voting Republican as a result. https://t.co/Z560ox3lg8 Joe Biden and Cal Cunningham don‚Äôt want to provide their honest answer on if they will pack the court: they will, and they will pack it with radical liberal judges who will take away our freedoms and change America as we know it. https://t.co/qG6ydcZCsa Unanswered questions about Cal Cunningham‚Äôs misconduct continue to pile up. 

North Carolinians deserve answers. https://t.co/jyZhae5s2z Thanks to my friend, Senator @votetimscott of South Carolina, for joining me for a Get-Out-The-Vote event in Matthews!

https://t.co/faO8lkM3Kz Cal Cunningham ran on truth and honor.

The future of this nation comes down to who wins this race ‚Äì our jobs, our economy, our support for law enforcement, and our freedoms and values.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking you to get out and vote today. Thank you for your support. https://t.co/IuXhACZ12m Cal Cunningham hasn't addressed the media since his ""disastrous"" Friday press conference.¬†He pitched himself as someone who will always run into the fight, but his affair with the wife of a disabled veteran got him under investigation, &amp; he‚Äôs run away from questions at all costs. Cal Cunningham‚Äôs dishonorable conduct has landed him investigations by the Army. 

Now, veterans are speaking out against him. https://t.co/t87Q2hTmwz Manufacturing is one of North Carolina‚Äôs main economic drivers.

https://t.co/rE3rsPphsV Cal Cunningham‚Äôs misconduct has landed him:

‚ùå US Army Reserve Investigation

‚ùå Possible Department of Defense Inspector General Investigation

‚ùå Possible Federal Election Commission Investigation

Yet ‚Äì Cunningham refuses to face North Carolinians and come clean. Here‚Äôs what North Carolina veterans are saying about Cal Cunningham's misconduct, which has him under investigation by the U.S. Army Reserve, and possibly the Inspector General of the Department of Defense. https://t.co/zdo2FPXYfd Cal Cunningham claims to be a champion of campaign finance transparency. He owes North Carolinians answers on if he broke the law in order to facilitate an affair with the wife of a disabled combat veteran. 

https://t.co/dRababaw6f Cal Cunningham is now facing a potential investigation by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense. This is on top of an investigation by the US Army Reserve. 

And Cunningham still refuses to be honest with North Carolinians about his scandal. 

https://t.co/DODu81TndL The only time Cal Cunningham even came close to answering tough questions about his scandal was when a reporter ran into him hiding out at a Starbucks.

His campaign has been one big lie to the voters.

He needs to come clean. https://t.co/HUySz9Dxcu"

What does this show? In 2014, lower income workers wage growth began outpacing higher income workers.

The income gap is getting narrower and has been for a while. https://t.co/p41cOdaPev Should we really consider us in a crisis of income inequality when the situation has been trending better for ten years, and recently at an accelerated pace? 

When updated and relevant data is available, we ought to use it. Let's take a look at the complete data set: 

It's the same graph, except it includes a very significant uptick right where Mr. Reich chose to stop providing data.

I was one of the 74 million Americans who voted for President Trump, in part because of the many accomplishments of his administration. Unfortunately, his behavior after the election betrayed the confidence millions of us placed in him. A lawless attempt to retain power by a president was one of the founders‚Äô greatest fears motivating the inclusion of the impeachment authorities in the U.S. Constitution. As a result of President Trump‚Äôs actions, for the first time in American history, the transfer of presidential power was not peaceful. He urged the mob to march on the Capitol for the explicit purpose of preventing Congress and the Vice President from formally certifying the results of the presidential election. All of this to hold on to power despite having legitimately lost. When these efforts failed, President Trump summoned thousands to Washington, D.C. and inflamed their passions by repeating disproven allegations about widespread fraud. His lawful, but unsuccessful, legal challenges failed due to lack of evidence. Then, he applied intense pressure on state and local officials to reverse the election outcomes in their states. However, these facts do not make President Trump‚Äôs conduct in response to losing the 2020 election acceptable. He began with dishonest, systematic attempts to convince supporters that he had won. The mainstream media was unrelentingly biased and hostile to the president. Both often overlooked violent riots when perpetrated in favor of causes they found sympathetic last summer. President Donald Trump‚Äôs defense team made several accurate observations at the impeachment trial. Many elected Democrats did want to impeach President Trump from the moment he won the 2016 election. As a Catholic school parent and graduate, I know what great work they do.

But retail investors should be free to purchase even highly-speculative stocks, just as hedge funds should be free to short them. And all investors should accept the consequences‚Äîwhether they gain or lose‚Äîfrom their decision. The rapid ascent of a few stocks has all of the characteristics of a bubble, and like all investment bubbles in history, this will end poorly for the people buying stock late‚Äîjust as it did for the hedge funds that shorted the stock early. I find it disturbing when retail investors who are simply seeking to buy a stock are frozen out of the market. Today we remember the lives that were senselessly stolen at the hands of a murderous madman. Antisemitism is a toxic ideology with no place in our society. We Remember the atrocities of the Holocaust to ensure that it can never happen again. #InternationalHolocaustRemembranceDay https://t.co/4I468w2n9b Nobody knows better what's best for a child than their parent. This is especially true when it comes to their education. I'm proud to join @SenatorTimScott in fighting for school choice. Giving parents and students the freedom to choose is how we put kids first! #SchoolChoiceWeek https://t.co/J3Us28s29S Thankfully I've convinced Mitch and Chuck to include rehearsal time in the forthcoming power sharing agreement. Our Blinding Lights cover needs a lot of work. https://t.co/U9oAy7OSfI I urge the president to follow through on this commitment by working with members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to pursue policies that will lead to peace and prosperity for all Americans. I am praying for President Biden and his success in leading our country forward. President Joe Biden took the oath of office today during a health crisis and significant political strife.

I commend President Biden for his call for national unity, and his assurance to those who did not support him that he will nevertheless be president for all Americans. Important info for international travelers: Starting Jan. 26, you'll need to provide a negative COVID test within at least 3 days of traveling by air back to the U.S.. This applies to everyone, U.S. citizens &amp; legal permanent residents included.

Now more than ever it is important we lend a hand to our fellow Americans, many of whom are struggling. If you are volunteering this year, please be safe and wear a mask. https://t.co/xQ5YVnyfGl A decade ago in Tucson, a madman slaughtered 6 people and injured 13 more, including Rep. @GabbyGiffords. We must do more to ensure violent criminals and the dangerously mentally ill can't get guns. Gabby is a leader on this. I'm grateful for her work and determination. My condolences to @CapitolPolice Officer Brian Sicknick's family and fellow officers. The thugs that are responsible for Officer Sicknick's murder must be arrested and prosecuted. Officer Sicknick and his fellow law enforcement officers are patriots, not the violent rioters. https://t.co/mszramPhbx Yesterday, lawmakers tried, but failed, to overturn the will of PA voters in the presidential election. Nowhere in our constitution is Congress vested with this authority. The people select the president, not Congress. Watch my defense of PA's voters: https://t.co/BzKmTk6CeZ This is an absolute disgrace. I appreciate the work of the United States Capitol Police under difficult circumstances. I am currently safe as are the few members of my staff that are currently at the Capitol complex. I voted for President Trump and endorsed him for re-election. But, on Wednesday, I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others. His narrow victory in Pennsylvania is easily explained by the decline in suburban support for President Trump and the president‚Äôs slightly smaller victory margins in most rural counties. I acknowledge that this past election, like all elections, had irregularities. But the evidence is overwhelming that Joe Biden won this election. President Trump‚Äôs own Attorney General, Bill Barr, stated ‚Äòwe have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.‚Äô They fail to acknowledge that these allegations have been adjudicated in courtrooms across America and were found to be unsupported by evidence. The senators justify their intent by observing that there have been many allegations of fraud. But allegations of fraud by a losing campaign cannot justify overturning an election. A fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the people to elect their own leaders. The effort by Sens. Hawley, Cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like Pennsylvania directly undermines this right. As we thankfully and mercifully turn our calendars to 2021, let us hope that the new year brings with it good health, prosperity and a brighter future for all Americans. Wishing everyone a very happy, healthy, and safe #NewYear! https://t.co/KiPw90F9HN Gov. Thornburgh led PA and Dept. of Justice successfully and with integrity. The steady nature in which he guided PA through the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island should serve as an example for all elected officials. I extend my condolences to Gov. Thornburgh‚Äôs family. https://t.co/vMiuEbMd57 Congress should continue helping workers who've lost their jobs. But blindly borrowing more than $600 billion so we can send $2,000 checks to millions of people who haven't lost any income is terrible policy. I won't consent to a vote on that. https://t.co/hCOlgcFPnq From my family to yours, Merry Christmas! https://t.co/4HezVhNOsQ Proof that the Democrats wanted to use the emergency lending facilities as a slush fund. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on our recent legislation shutting them down: https://t.co/OtpAiTcXS9 Win for taxpayers and for an independent Fed. Repurposes $429 billion in unused CARES Act funds to help pay for the new relief. Closes CARES Act lending facilities, blocks restart/copycats- stops Dems from using the Fed to circumvent Congress for policies they can't get enacted. https://t.co/a6VXulLrQK Joining @SenStabenow and me will be experts from across the country: Dr. Randall Bateman from @WUSTL, Maria Carrillo from @alzassociation, Dr. Nikolay Dokholyan from @PSUScience, and Dr. Richard Mohs from @GAP_Foundation. Tune in here: https://t.co/1yNEidkjtP Nearly 300,000 PA seniors are currently fighting #Alzheimers Disease. At 2:30 PM today, @SenStabenow and I will lead a bipartisan hearing examining testing and treatment options for Alzheimer's, as well as the cost of providing care to someone afflicted with the disease. I particularly appreciated Attorney General Barr‚Äôs work to end sanctuary city policies, keep guns away from felons and the dangerously mentally ill, and support law enforcement officers. I wish Attorney General Barr well in any future endeavors. Unfazed by political pressure from either side of the aisle, Attorney General Barr proved time and again that he understood his ultimate obligations were to serve as the nation‚Äôs top law enforcement officer and to uphold the Constitution. Attorney General Bill Barr has served the American people and the Department of Justice with distinction under two separate administrations ‚Äì Presidents Donald Trump and George H.W. Bush. Getting a safe and effective vaccine out to the American public this year is a testament to the dedication and perseverance of all who were involved in its development. I am hopeful a brighter spring awaits. https://t.co/EIefO2lnJW On this day in history 233 years ago, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania joined the Union. Needless to say, quite a good deal of history has been made here in the time since. Happy Birthday Pennsylvania! https://t.co/mT4CACaF7B To all across Pennsylvania who are celebrating tonight, I wish you a very happy #Hanukkah https://t.co/U0GvZcfp2G No legislation can return to Madison the time and innocence she lost at the hands of a stalker, but it can aid in preventing such horrible experiences for others in the future. Read more on @abc27News: https://t.co/TAGSg0Q2mZ .@SenBobCasey, @RepBrianFitz and I have fought to make sure that we do. Last night, Congress passed our bipartisan bill which will enhance federal criminal penalties on those who stalk or cyberstalk minors. I look forward to the president signing it into law. The horrifying experience that Madison and the entire Zezzo family were subjected to is proof that we need tough penalties to punish online predators. At first, despite all the horror and grief, her stalker was only sentenced to probation and counseling. When the behavior escalated thereafter, he was ultimately sent to prison. No child should ever experience the trauma Madison Zezzo did. At age 13, her best friend's father stalked and harassed her online. From posting thousands of doctored, horrifying images to sending her unceasing explicit messages, her early teenage years were consumed by a monster. Wishing @GovernorTomWolf a full recovery. I am glad to hear he isn‚Äôt currently experiencing any symptoms. COVID-19 can infect anyone. Don‚Äôt forget to wear a mask when you venture out and wash your hands regularly! https://t.co/9i9nURNQF5 December 7, 1941 will forever be a day that lives in infamy.

Happy #Gurpurab to all in Pennsylvania's vibrant Sikh community and Sikhs around the world. While the celebration may be different this year, the ability to appreciate Guru Nanak‚Äôs teachings remain unchanged. This Thanksgiving will be different for families all across Pennsylvania, but that doesn't mean we can't reflect on all that we have to be thankful for this year. Whether you're celebrating in-person or virtually, I wish everyone a very happy, and safe #Thanksgiving. https://t.co/lWjZKUpKTJ As the Senate considers Dr. Yellen‚Äôs nomination to lead Treasury, I look forward to discussing with her a variety of issues, especially the requirement for CARES Act temporary emergency lending facilities to shut down by year-end and remain shut down, absent congressional action. https://t.co/7Ps4XvbkE5 Read my statement on today‚Äôs Pennsylvania federal court decision, and congratulating President-Elect Biden: https://t.co/tCCXWxIUoR https://t.co/MaxfHCtK1x The work Chairman Powell and Secretary Mnuchin did standing these facilities up ‚Äì under extraordinary circumstances ‚Äì was enormously successful in stabilizing and normalizing credit markets. Their work has led to record levels of credit availability across the economy. I appreciate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell agreeing to return unused CARES Act funds as part of the statutorily prescribed wind down of the emergency lending facilities. https://t.co/15JgoXsyCH With liquidity restored, they should expire, as Congress intended and the law requires, by December 31, 2020. These temporary facilities helped to both normalize markets and produce record levels of liquidity. Congress‚Äôs intent was clear: these facilities were to be temporary, to provide liquidity, and to cease operations by the end of 2020. stabilizing credit markets so private credit could once again flow to businesses, states, and municipalities. These facilities, which were established in response to the unprecedented market turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year, have successfully achieved their intended purpose: I applaud Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin‚Äôs decision to wind down, by year-end, the CARES Act‚Äôs temporary, emergency lending facilities, as Congress intended and the law requires. To better understand how we can combat the opioid epidemic, I'm hosting a virtual roundtable at 11AM with @ONDCP Dir. Jim Carroll. Joining us is: Dr. Julie Donohue - @PittTweet, Dr. Jeanmarie Perrone - @PennMedicine, &amp; David Kennedy - @PSTA_1962. Watch: https://t.co/IMCYB3woab In PA, opioid overdoses and overdose deaths are already higher than all of 2019. While COVID-19 continues to impact our country, mandatory isolation is taking its toll on people suffering from addiction. It is imperative we do not forget about these vulnerable populations. Our bill will: 

‚úÖIncrease oversight of underperforming facilities
‚úÖIncrease educational resources for such facilities
‚úÖIncrease transparency for patients/families
‚úÖCreate a council to advise @HHSGov on quality assessment of such facilities 

More: https://t.co/C3eaR7kARp Two of every three Pennsylvanians to die from COVID-19 were residents of nursing homes or other long-term care facilities. @SenBobCasey and I introduced a bipartisan bill to combat the systemic failures at these nursing homes in Pennsylvania and across the country. BANNED: Eating at a restaurant, going to school, work, a funeral, or a wedding.

PERMITTED: Huge protests in support of liberal policies or favored political candidates. 
 
Seems inconsistent and arbitrary, but I'm sure Mayor Kenney and Philly officials have data to back this up. https://t.co/BWrJ4YpQQp Today, we honor the heroes who have worn the uniform of our great nation.

Wishing you and your family nothing but good health and happiness! https://t.co/ACgxN2OvNK This means campaign representatives must have meaningful access to observe whether the law is being followed. I strongly encourage all state and local officials to ensure that this happens as the election process is completed. Democracy succeeds only when all sides can trust that the election process is fair and transparent. Given the extremely close result, the American people must be assured that the process is being conducted with integrity. Today‚Äôs announcement by the media of the election‚Äôs outcome is a projection. A final outcome will be reached when the election process concludes, which is after all legal votes have been counted, litigation is resolved, and any recounts are completed. President Trump and former Vice President Biden have run hard, spirited campaigns that have inspired record civic engagement. I applaud both of them for their desire to serve our nation. Today is election day! Make a plan. Be safe. #Vote. To learn where your polling location is, visit https://t.co/arJXvgHI42.

Today, we learned that the economy grew at the fastest pace on record last quarter, an unprecedented rebound. https://t.co/jlxuVWtXk9 Police officers are hardworking, honorable people who do the right thing and protect our communities. An investigation into yesterday‚Äôs police-involved shooting is underway and I am confident any questions will be fully addressed by the investigation. https://t.co/bWbYcWYt9j According to the Philadelphia Police Department, 30 officers were injured by rioters last night, including a female sergeant who was struck by a speeding truck. While Americans have the right to peacefully protest, no one has the right to riot and loot. The unacceptable violence in Philadelphia last night underscores the need for elected officials to support our law enforcement officers who face danger on a daily basis. Today we remember the lives that were cut short and pray for the victims, their families and friends, and all those who worship at the Tree of Life Synagogue. In that darkness, we also saw the best in our community: the heroism of police and other first responders, the care and skill of medical personnel, and the love of people from all faiths and walks of life who came together to mourn. Two years ago, a cowardly murderer stole the lives of 11 innocent people and wounded 6 others at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. That day, we saw the horror and brutality fomented by anti-Semitism, a repugnant and vitriolic ideology with no place in our society. She understands that a judge must act as a neutral umpire who applies the law, including the U.S. Constitution, as written, not as an unelected super legislator who decides cases based on her preferred policy outcome. https://t.co/z1MH4SP1ur Most importantly, Judge Barrett has shown a deep commitment to the proper role of a federal judge in our constitutional system. Given she is a working mother with school-aged children, she will bring to the Supreme Court a background that will add to its diversity. I was proud to join my colleagues in confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court today. Judge Barrett clearly has the intelligence, experience, and character needed to serve on our nation‚Äôs highest court. My op-ed in @GoErie: From working to restore Lake Erie, helping farmers, and cleaning up polluted sites, the @EPA under @realDonaldTrump and @EPAAWheeler has cleaned up our environment without dragging down the economy. https://t.co/fxhdILfKKT Judge #AmyConeyBarrett showed deep legal knowledge, commitment to equal justice under the law, and a clear understanding of a judge‚Äôs role to be a neutral umpire, not an un-elected super legislator. I look forward to supporting her confirmation to #SCOTUS. https://t.co/1E7gxhTrQw New from @GovEdRendell and me for the @PhillyInquirer: 79% of Pennsylvanians support term limits. Term limits would allow members of Congress to operate knowing that they can take risks without jeopardizing a potential lifetime career. https://t.co/lXq6uAGrwK I will be making an announcement about my political future at 10:00 AM.

Read our letter: https://t.co/UPrhQ5Az6p I've joined with @RepBrianFitz, @RepJohnJoyce, @RepFredKeller, @MikeKellyPA, @RepMeuser, @RepScottPerry, @GReschenthaler, @RepSmucker, and @CongressmanGT in calling on Gov. Wolf to reconsider his opposition to allowing in-person attendance at outdoor sports. There‚Äôs no reason why Pennsylvanians cannot responsibly enjoy outdoor sports for the 2020-2021 season. Programs like @Temple_FB, @PennStateFball, and @Pitt_FB are capable of developing plans that keep their fans safe. To all observing Yom Kippur, I wish you an easy fast and a good and sweet year! https://t.co/8s5Y8Cdx26 I look forward to reviewing Judge Barrett‚Äôs record further in the coming weeks and speaking with her soon as I consider her nomination. #SCOTUS Importantly, Judge Barrett has shown an unfailing commitment to the proper role of a judge ‚Äì which is to apply the law, including the U.S. Constitution, as written, and not to decide cases based on a preferred policy or outcome. As a working mother with young children, Judge Barrett would also bring to the Supreme Court a background that will add to its diversity. Given Judge Barrett‚Äôs intellect, strong legal credentials, and impeccable character, I was proud to support her confirmation to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017. These same attributes will serve her well on the nation‚Äôs highest court. I am pleased that President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. When power is divided during an election year, the Senate‚Äôs general practice has been to leave open a SCOTUS vacancy so voters may resolve the disagreement...The circumstances surrounding the current vacancy are different. My full statement here:
https://t.co/x4WgvHVw04 https://t.co/sueTbr5R9m Simply put, Justice Ginsburg left an indelible mark that will resonate for generations. I extend my prayers and deepest condolences to Justice Ginsburg‚Äôs family, friends, and colleagues. As just the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg was a trailblazer in the legal profession. While I usually disagreed with her legal and political views, she proved time and again that it is possible to disagree with someone without being disagreeable. Our nation mourns the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Renowned for her legal intellect and sharp opinions, Justice Ginsburg served on our nation‚Äôs highest court for nearly three decades with distinction and honor. L‚ÄôShana Tovah to everyone across Pennsylvania celebrating Rosh Hashanah! May your new year be good and sweet. https://t.co/e8rZKAaehg Today‚Äôs blatantly political decision to violate the law irresponsibly heightens the risk that our state will experience a lengthy, disputed, and controversial outcome in what is expected to be an extremely close presidential race. Once again, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has decided that laws have no meaning. The current state election statute, which was signed by Governor Wolf less than a year ago, is clear that mail-in ballots must be received by 8:00 PM on Election Day in order to be counted. As a member of the @America250 Commission, I'm happy to share with you a quiz to celebrate #ConstitutionWeek!

I spoke on the Senate floor today on my recent trip to the souther border &amp; the commonsense actions that the Biden Administration can take to address the problem at our southern border created by @POTUS's unilateral actions. https://t.co/heS1Z846FH Alabamians don‚Äôt need Hollywood elites or politicians telling them how to run their lives.

The recent Amazon vote to reject unionizing just goes to show how Alabama‚Äôs Right to Work law has, and will continue to benefit our workers and economy. https://t.co/EYLcnVuFtE üì∫ I'll be joining @larry_kudlow on @FoxBusiness this afternoon at 4:30 ET to talk about the recent Amazon union vote.

Tune in to listen! As workers across the country and now in Bessemer have demonstrated, they value their Right to Work protections, and I‚Äôll continue to be a strong voice for their rights in the Senate. It‚Äôs unfortunate to see President Biden &amp; Democrats in Washington trying to override state laws and make forced unionization the national norm. The folks at Amazon‚Äôs Bessemer facility made the decision they felt is best for them, their families, &amp; their community. But the important thing is that they had the choice. Alabama‚Äôs Right to Work law gives workers a choice in whether they want to unionize or not. The numbers from @CBP show just how the bad the #BidenBorderCrisis has gotten.

This was predictable &amp; preventable. It will only get worse unless @POTUS reinstates President Trump's successful policies. https://t.co/nZG8jk2BRT Every penny of every $ in an infrastructure bill should go toward improving the roads, bridges, &amp; ports we rely on. I‚Äôm ready to work on a targeted, bipartisan infrastructure bill that addresses our country‚Äôs needs, but @POTUS's current proposal fails that test by a long shot. Only 5% of Pres. Biden‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù proposal actually goes to roads and bridges.¬†

The rest¬†goes towards the Green New Deal &amp;¬†a progressive wish list, leaving rural communities behind.

Hallelujah, Christ has risen today! https://t.co/lcJPvgxv5P This is another example of progressive pressure under @POTUS - he‚Äôs not the uniter, but the divider in chief. MLB has cowered to the will of the radical left and taken a stance against fair elections and voter ID. Sports have unified Americans - now, cancel culture is coming for sports, too. It‚Äôs a shame. Today is a sad day. We lost one of our own. I send my deepest condolences to the family of USCP Officer William ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù Evans.

Praying for a speedy recovery of the second officer and for peace and comfort for Officer Evans‚Äôs loved ones in this difficult time. Praying for Capitol police officers injured today. https://t.co/Z7XvhxYgr4 Wishing everyone a blessed Good Friday. https://t.co/Ah4xgAKkcH and am willing to work with our Democratic colleagues on a thoughtful and targeted approach. But if we‚Äôre going to waste our time on another partisan, progressive wish list like the one President Biden proposed yesterday, you can bet I‚Äôll oppose it. We can‚Äôt keep throwing money at our problems as if this were a game of Monopoly. We need to focus on putting the virus behind us, getting folks back to work, and returning our kids to school. I‚Äôm in favor of improving our bridges and roads . . . when we need them the most. Hiking taxes on businesses hurts workers and raises costs for consumers. We saw record wage growth thanks to the 2017 Trump tax cuts, and this is Democrats‚Äô attempt to erase those gains at the expense of American workers. As it stands now, only 6% of the $2.25 trillion proposed actually goes to fix bridges and roads, while the rest goes to big cities on the coasts and progressive priorities, leaving rural communities behind. As we continue recovering from the pandemic, this proposal will kill jobs Our country could use targeted investment in infrastructure, but this proposal is definitely not it. Once again, President Biden &amp; Dems are proposing a massive spending bill which is being advertised as an infrastructure package, but is really the Green New Deal in disguise. Good to catch up with local media @whnt, @waff48, and @rocketcitynow before Redstone Arsenal tour, talking about storm recovery, my Huntsville visits, and recent trip to the southern border. https://t.co/NGDnr9FN6o Sat down with Dan Schaffer at @WAAYTV to talk about my recent trip to the Southern border, visiting Huntsville, &amp; going to some of the most affected areas in Alabama following last week‚Äôs tornadoes.

https://t.co/3GKZeTodw0 Across Alabama, millions of hard-working farmers, producers, &amp; foresters work tirelessly -rain or shine- to ensure our country has a continuous, safe food supply.

On #NationalAgDay, we recognize all in the ag industry who are committed to feeding, clothing, &amp; fueling our nation. https://t.co/h9FqPTsEHt Border security is important to Alabamians- that‚Äôs why I will be traveling to our border to see the growing crisis firsthand. I will speak w/ law enforcement on the ground &amp; see the disastrous impact of Pres. Biden‚Äôs EOs. https://t.co/084StTv60C Americans who inherit family-owned farms, ranches, &amp; businesses are often forced to sell or lay off employees in order to pay the Death Tax.
 
Congress should be focused on creating a tax &amp; regulatory environment that allows businesses to thrive, not one that stunts growth. https://t.co/iUgIGhEsjN Proud of @BoeingSpace, @NASA and the many Alabamians who made this successful hot fire test possible!

https://t.co/0Lyi5Z2qvF The situation is getting worse by the day as a result of President Biden‚Äôs open border policies. I‚Äôll be joining @JohnCornyn &amp; @SenTedCruz to visit our southern border &amp; hear from folks on the frontlines of this crisis.

https://t.co/8UwuZ7lndZ Congrats @NASA_SLS on a successful Green Run hot fire.

I continue to pray for those who have been severely affected. Thanks to the leadership of first responders &amp; @AlabamaEMA, communities were prepared, and Alabama lives were saved. The physical destruction is still devastating, &amp; it‚Äôll be a tough road ahead to recovery. Our state and local leaders have a game plan and are fully prepared to handle this storm. I strongly encourage every Alabamian to monitor the weather and stay up to date on the latest.

‚¨ÜÔ∏èIllegal border crossings have increased almost 30%
‚¨ÜÔ∏èUnaccompanied minor crossings increased over 60%

If this Biden-created crisis is to end, @POTUS must reverse his open border policies to protect our nat'l security. President Biden's policies:

‚ùåhalting border wall construction
‚ùåwelcoming illegal immigrants
‚ùåpromising amnesty

have caused the crisis at the Southern border. 

This problem was preventable and predictable. We need to reinstate MPP &amp; build the wall. Democrat's ""For the People‚Äù Act is a top-down, partisan power-grab that will rewrite our election laws. 

It‚Äôs not ‚Äúfor the people,‚Äù ‚Äúof the people,‚Äù or ‚Äúby the people.‚Äù https://t.co/jNnsnKO3Eo The Biden Admin is sending FEMA to help on the border, but they still won‚Äôt admit there‚Äôs a crisis? What is happening on the border is a direct result of Pres Biden undoing Pres Trump‚Äôs successful border security policies‚Äì it was preventable &amp; predictable.
https://t.co/aznpQV9vxi We‚Äôve already spent nearly half a billion of tax $ to convert the Capitol into a military complex, &amp; now they want to keep Nat‚Äôl Guard for 2 more months, despite the lack of a credible threat.

We learned a lot in 2020; we learned the meaning of resilience &amp; how to be there for our neighbors. We learned American innovation can¬†produce a safe &amp; effective vaccine. 4/12 is the deadline to file for @SBAgov‚Äôs disaster loan assistance if you were affected by severe weather last April.
 
This applies to small biz, ag coops, &amp; private nonprofit orgs in Blount, Cullman, DeKalb, Etowah, Jackson, Marshall &amp; Walker counties. https://t.co/cg0SDwOb1u Alabama farmers and foresters know what is best for their lands and the federal government does not need some sort of one-size-fits-all climate policy forced upon them.

Sec.

https://t.co/M0bPPVWM38 Reversing the successful immigration policies of President Trump, like border wall construction and the Migrant Protection Protocols, is a mistake.

President Biden‚Äôs decisions have led to a growing border crisis.
 
https://t.co/oSpoMgEQZu Last month, I wrote to Sec. Mayorkas because I am concerned that the Department is NOT following CDC health guidelines for illegal immigrants entering the U.S. along the Southwest border.
 
I have yet to receive a response. https://t.co/dV5s5jxpho President Biden‚Äôs open border policies threaten the health and safety of Americans &amp; our economy during a time when we need recovery.

It is clear that DHS @SecMayorkas has no intention of upholding the rule of law, only carrying out President Biden's radical agenda. https://t.co/Kmy5nvcHqK At-risk kids can't be mentored through a screen ‚Äî time to open schools https://t.co/ODU24K4SV1 Senate Democrats Reject Sen. Tuberville's Amendment to Protect Women's Sports and Title IX https://t.co/ABdTBqJFGZ This isn‚Äôt ‚ÄòCOVID relief,‚Äô it‚Äôs ‚Äòliberal relief.‚Äô Democrats have made that much clear from the beginning by refusing to negotiate Republicans and using reconciliation to ram through their wish list items. 

Read my statement here: https://t.co/fFLaq7bS2o I offered an amendment that would protect Title IX &amp; the millions of female athletes who benefited from it. The¬†amendment would ensure education funding in the bill is targeted to schools that are focused on COVID response &amp; recovery rather than pushing a liberal¬†agenda. https://t.co/b5OOuRdnJ1 I‚Äôve had a front-row seat to how beneficial Title IX has been for women‚Äôs sports. It has ensured that female athletes had the same access to resources that male athletes received.
 
Read more my op-ed from earlier this year:https://t.co/gOhszkVuD1 The economic recovery President Trump put into motion is continuing, and the best thing we can do to keep the momentum going is to get people back to work. Shutdowns stifle economic growth.

https://t.co/doE7FxYuc4 The MAJORITY of this ""relief"" bill funds Democrat priorities &amp; special interest groups:
 
‚ùåGives taxpayer $ to environmental ""justice"" grants
‚ùåFunds Planned Parenthood &amp; other abortion providers
‚ùåBails out failed blue states My friend from Texas is absolutely spot on. 

Not only is this ""relief"" bill full of pork, more than of 1/2 the money from 5 previous bipartisan bills remain unspent.
 
We should be getting that money to folks &amp; small businesses in need. https://t.co/fcVfwmbHD3 Most of the money included in this COVID bill won't be seen for years.

""Relief"" is the wrong word to describe this bill - ""reckless"" is more accurate. Reckless spending habits are no way to govern. https://t.co/Ak239pwxYu Every American should be concerned that only 1% of this ‚Äúrelief‚Äù bill goes toward vaccines, while the vast majority goes towards the Democrats‚Äô wish list. What does $50 million for ‚Äúclimate justice‚Äù have to do with fighting the COVID pandemic?

https://t.co/nSV90W6T3j The Treasury Department can't print money fast enough to keep up with these progressive wish lists.

This ‚Äúrelief‚Äù bill isn‚Äôt the targeted relief we need.

One thing I‚Äôve learned, is that education is the key to freedom. Freedom to live the life you want. I‚Äôve seen firsthand how education can give you a leg up and a way out. It‚Äôs a way to achieve the American Dream. https://t.co/gjuqic6JvV I coached young people from all backgrounds ‚Äì rich, poor, and everybody in between. I mentored young people of all races, religions, and economic backgrounds. I‚Äôve been an educator, a coach, and a mentor to young people for 40 years.

"Van Hollen, Chris",ChrisVanHollen,VanHollenforMD,Maryland,Maryland,Senator," Our AAPI communities are reeling from the violence, hate, and vitriol that has increased dramatically over the last year. It‚Äôs up to each and every one of us to stand up and speak out. Congress must past the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, and we must work together to #StopAsianHate. #DCStateHood is a civil rights issue. 
 
Today @OversightDems passed a bill to make D.C. the 51st state.
 
Alongside @SenatorCarper and @EleanorNorton I‚Äôll continue fighting to get this done. CEO pay skyrocketed during the pandemic, while workers faced layoffs. The Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act would increase the tax rate on big corporations with excessive pay gaps between their CEO and average worker, raising funds to invest in working Americans. https://t.co/15GkSomMZt This morning, I paid my respects to Capitol Police Officer William Evans who lost his life in the line of duty. He was a father, husband, brother, son, and an 18-year veteran of the Capitol Police. My heart goes out to his loved ones.
https://t.co/FbiIfLNEiW Thank you to the Maryland General Assembly for a productive session, including overdue and historic reforms to our policing systems. The General Assembly overrode the Governor‚Äôs veto to set an example for the rest of the nation. Not to mention Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership‚Äù also resulted in Iran:

-Increasing its stockpile of enriched uranium 12x
-Ratcheting up R&amp;D on advanced centrifuges and restarting enrichment at Fordow
-Slashing its nuclear breakout time from one year under the JCPOA to a matter of months https://t.co/SA0mHefpKQ Child care providers and families have been struggling‚Äîincluding local Head Start centers like the one I visited in Baltimore with @Call_Me_Dutch. The good news is that help is here for Maryland: $513 million for families and child care providers and $11 million for Head Start. https://t.co/lVm6atltt6 The rollout of vaccines in MD has been inadequate and inequitable so others are helping out. Stopped by Total Health Care‚Äôs new Mobile Health Unit in Baltimore made possible by private donations and the Biden Admin is ensuring they will receive vaccine directly from the feds. https://t.co/68xFcln5ai For years, we‚Äôve fought to fully fund our public schools through the Keep Our PACT Act. @POTUS‚Äôs new budget plan brings us closer than ever‚Äîwith a historic investment to ensure opportunity for all students regardless of their zip code and resources to expand community schools. The gun violence epidemic is tearing apart communities. We need to act. The measures @POTUS announced today are an important first step. Congress must follow with more. https://t.co/35G4hrwg2M On Yom HaShoah we remember the millions of lives lost in the Holocaust and pledge #NeverAgain. That requires each of us to take responsibility to stand up and speak out against anti-Semitism and hate in all forms. #HolocaustRemembranceDay It‚Äôs great to have @TreyMancini back on the field at Camden Yards for today‚Äôs home opener.

Grateful for of the first responders. I‚Äôve been in touch with @JanGardnerExec and @FredCityGovt Mayor O‚ÄôConnor and will stay in close contact with local officials. The 2017 GOP Tax Scam created perverse incentives for some corporations to ship jobs overseas. The good news is the American Jobs Plan is financed, in part, by closing these tax haven loopholes. We should reward businesses that hire workers at home, not those who export jobs. So let‚Äôs get this straight: Mitch McConnell opposes HR1 and S1 because he wants big corporations to be able to spend gobs of secret money on ads to influence voters‚Äô choices but he opposes CEOs speaking out publicly to defend voting rights. https://t.co/EGyeLqsojT Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Baltimore is All-Star ready! https://t.co/u74u8zWLRB My heart is with the loved ones of Officer Evans. He was an 18-year veteran of the force and worked to defend the heart of our democracy and keep us safe. We are forever indebted to him and mourn this terrible loss.
https://t.co/9w0RVBLyIz Monitoring the situation at the Capitol closely. My thoughts are with the Capitol Police Officers‚Äîwho risk their lives daily to protect our democracy‚Äîand with their families. The pattern never ends. Republicans on Capitol Hill always say they are for modernizing our infrastructure until it comes time to pay for it. If they don‚Äôt want big corporations to pay more, ask them: what is their plan? Thanks to Baltimore Main Streets for the creative things they're doing to help local businesses during these difficult times! I joined them this week to deliver good news: more relief is on the way to support their efforts. Together, we will weather the storm and emerge stronger. The American Jobs Plan will generate millions of good-paying jobs as we confront the climate crisis and advance environmental justice. A key provision is based on the National Climate Bank Act that @SenMarkey and I introduced to spur clean energy investment. Let‚Äôs pass it! Every American who wants a job should be able to find one. In his American Jobs Plan @POTUS supports the establishment of a subsidized jobs plan‚Äîlike the one @RonWyden and I introduced: The Long-Term Unemployment Elimination Act. Millions are counting on us to get this done. As we mark the end of #WomensHistoryMonth, we‚Äôre faced with a new report that says‚Äîunless we act‚Äîit may take 61.5 years for women to achieve pay equity in America. Even one more day is too long and we must start by passing the #PaycheckFairness Act. https://t.co/8oHgBM6Ev4 The American Jobs Plan is a bold package to build an economy that works for everyone and will:

‚Üí Modernize our transportation networks
‚Üí Invest in clean energy
‚Üí Expand affordable housing
‚Üí Ensure access to clean water and broadband

That's just the start. The White House announcement of a strong slate of qualified judicial nominees‚Äîincluding two terrific candidates from MD‚Äîis a welcome change after the last four years. Good to see judicial nominees who are committed to delivering equal justice under the law.https://t.co/TgWBU9mFim Under a painting of the Callaway Plantation, Gov.

It's the Maryland Way! https://t.co/FYb4jXSgdI The Capitol is the citadel of our democracy and we should not turn it into a fortress. We can secure Congress without walling it off from the American people. Today @RoyBlunt and I are joining @EleanorNorton in introducing the No Fences Act. https://t.co/aRoYjJYd6v A year ago, I joined forces with @JRosenworcelFCC and MD teachers, parents, and ed experts to discuss the digital divide.

Send us your Qs: https://t.co/t8o0Hajl8u Every 13 hours someone in Maryland is killed with a gun.
 
This loss of life represents far more than a number. It's an epidemic devastating families, communities, and our entire country.
 
We must act now. https://t.co/N2d0uV4xxk Women have borne the brunt of the economic impact of the pandemic and still earn only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men‚Äîand the gap is even larger for women of color. We must tackle this wage gap and pass Paycheck Fairness Act now. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/8x2utYym80 The pandemic is not over. 

It‚Äôs clear that struggling small businesses still need our support. 

That‚Äôs why the House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan measure to extend the Paycheck Protection Program last week. The Senate must do the same without delay.https://t.co/DVnn9KMZ4b Our democracy must work #ForthePeople. But GOP state legislatures are erecting barriers to citizens‚Äô voting and corporations are using secret money to drown out the voices of the people. We must strengthen our democracy by passing the For the People Act. https://t.co/LFKhpWrWOp 11 years ago, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. It's needed now more than ever. @POTUS opened enrollment and in just two weeks 200,000 more Americans signed up. The GOP sought to rip away affordable health care, but access to health care is a human right. Yesterday, we lost 10 lives to another senseless mass shooting. And every day we see the toll of gun violence on our communities. Today @JudiciaryDems held a hearing on common sense reforms. We need real action‚Äînow.
https://t.co/XJOso9abgl D.C. is home to over 700,000 citizens who pay more in federal taxes than 22 other states but have no vote in how those dollars are spent. It's past time for them to have a voice in our democracy. Today, @OversightDems is holding a hearing on #DCStatehood‚Äîlet‚Äôs get this done. Maryland‚Äôs HBCUs are essential to our success. Equitable investment is long overdue. I‚Äôm glad the General Assembly has worked to correct this historic wrong. Now, we need the Governor to sign this bill into law immediately.
https://t.co/GF4YkBS1QH We must reimagine our approach to public safety. Police are often called to situations that would be better handled by other first responders. As the @PostOpinions says, the Community-Based Response Act I introduced with @RepKarenBass will address that. https://t.co/kIe9zJbCCB This pandemic hit our communities hard, but it‚Äôs also led to incredible acts of humanity. This Baltimore business owner heard about a customer‚Äôs final wish‚Äîher favorite tempura broccoli. And he drove 6 hours to make sure she got it. https://t.co/QbUUutHyPb Without access to high-speed internet connections, our children risk falling behind. That‚Äôs why we fought for funds to help close the digital divide, securing $7 billion for this crucial investment in the #AmericanRescuePlan. This is a big step forward. Our markets work best when we have all the facts. When corporations don‚Äôt disclose climate risk, consumers and investors can‚Äôt make fully informed decisions. We must #ActOnClimate across the board‚Äîand that means requiring transparency about the threat of climate change. Many big corporate CEOs cash in massive paychecks while their workers‚Äô wages barely keep up with the cost of living. We‚Äôve got to meaningfully address income inequality in our nation‚Äîand our bill will help narrow these obscene gaps.
https://t.co/UqJ1S5A4LE Immigrants add to the dynamism of our communities &amp; bolster our economy. Providing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers &amp; TPS recipients is not only the right thing to do‚Äîit'll help strengthen our nation. The House passed the #DreamAndPromise Act today. Now the Senate must act. https://t.co/TlrnfhKmyA We‚Äôre in a long-term unemployment crisis. That's why @RonWyden and I are introducing a plan to help get Americans back to work. Our bill creates incentives to hire those who have been out of a job for a long time. It's one of the best tools we have and it's proven to work. We cannot be silent in the face the violence and hate targeting AAPI individuals. Each of us has a moral obligation to forcefully speak out against this bigotry and racism. #StopAAPIHate  https://t.co/zRCh7oeJR2 Glad to see that today the Biden Administration used the authority under our Hong Kong Autonomy Act to sanction 24 officials working to strip the Hong Kong people of their freedoms. The U.S. will not stand idly by as China attempts to extinguish democracy in #HongKong. https://t.co/FWfgyZIBRW It‚Äôs time to put our democracy back in the hands of the American people. We just introduced the #ForThePeople Act in the Senate‚Äîlet's pass this bill now to end secret $$ in politics, strengthen our democracy and stop GOP state legislatures from bringing back Jim Crow voting laws. Trump refused to establish clear penalties for Russian interference in our elections, blocking the DETER Act at every turn. The report released by @ODNIgov makes it clear why. Glad to see the Biden Administration stand up to Putin and those attempting to undermine our democracy. https://t.co/HIKmTVCJKT There is a dangerous mismatch between our global challenges and the strategy &amp; resources we're deploying to meet them. Instead of fighting yesterday‚Äôs wars, we must meet the threats of today.

Our bill, the No Tax Breaks for Outsourcing Act, does just that. https://t.co/QTuqno0xeh One year after #BreonnaTaylor's killing, the fight for justice, equal protection, and accountability is more urgent than ever. The House has passed the #JusticeInPolicing Act and the Senate must do the same. 
https://t.co/6bzoeFVO1O Looking forward to building on the policies in the #AmericanRescuePlan. And I‚Äôll stand shoulder to shoulder with @32BJSEIU to do just that. https://t.co/3uOCLPyVtJ 97% of Americans support universal background checks. The House passed #HR8 and @SenSchumer plans to have a vote in the Senate on this bill to save lives‚Äîit shouldn't be a partisan issue. I urge all senators to listen to the American people and vote for this common-sense measure! https://t.co/oHS6fXnalm The American Rescue Plan showed what‚Äôs possible when our government is able to act FOR the people. If we have to choose between protecting our democracy or sticking with antiquated anti-democratic Senate rules, the choice is clear. 

The filibuster must go.https://t.co/cN3uyifoWX We know the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. Designating a #ChesapeakeNationalRecreationArea will highlight that reality, bring more resources, and ensure Americans can enjoy it for generations to come. Excited to announce our Working Group on this effort today! https://t.co/U84oU53HHm Brighter days are ahead. The President just signed the American Rescue Plan into law, sending immediate help to our families, workers, and small businesses and providing a crucial boost to our fight against COVID-19. This is a historic victory for the American people! https://t.co/NhHUarqaEw 65% of the benefits from Trump‚Äôs tax cut went straight to the top 20% while only 1% went to the Americans most in need. The #AmericanRescuePlan does just the opposite, providing critical relief to lower-income and middle-class families to ensure they can weather this storm. https://t.co/Ejcp3SoEQI Great news! Judge Merrick Garland has been confirmed as Attorney General. And none too soon. He will have his hands full restoring credibility to the DOJ, addressing the rise of domestic terrorism, protecting voting rights, and ensuring equal justice. Today is #HarrietTubman Day‚Äîa day to honor this American hero who escaped slavery and became a leading champion for freedom and justice. Every American should know her story. Today we‚Äôre reintroducing our bill to bring a statue of this Maryland daughter to the U.S. Capitol. https://t.co/4ly9Zj8ZnG The House has just acted and the American Rescue Plan is on its way to President Biden's desk for signature. Great news for Americans. Help is on the way! https://t.co/b4oEcF13Bx The right to organize has brought American workers fairer wages, better benefits, and safer workplaces. Last night, the House passed the #PROAct, to help guarantee more Americans this right. The Senate must take up this bill and put power back into the hands of our workers! https://t.co/Tcf5eFlMVJ Wall Street churns on high-frequency trading‚Äîputting everyday investors at risk. @BrianSchatz, @SenWarren, and I plan to introduce a bill to impose a tiny fee on Wall Street transactions to lower volatility, cut income inequality and invest the $$ in economic opportunity for all. https://t.co/lpOO4jtwmF Tackling the climate crisis is also good economic policy. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good news that our clean energy accelerator and HOPE for HOMES Act are included in @EnergyCommerce‚Äôs new CLEAN Future Act. Clean energy lowers energy costs AND grows jobs when we do it right. Venezuela has become a dangerous and failed state. Forcing Venezuelans currently residing in the U.S. to return home now could be a death sentence. Both Republicans and Democrats have called for President Biden to grant them Temporary Protected Status. Glad to see him do it. Long-term unemployment is devastating to workers &amp; our economy. The #AmericanRescuePlan extends vital UI benefits, but we must do more. I‚Äôm working with @RonWyden &amp; @SenatorBaldwin on legislation to ensure these workers aren‚Äôt locked out of a job for good.
https://t.co/yHMVVa7yAO As we mark #InternationalWomensDay, President Biden is taking steps to reverse Trump-era policies that took us backwards in the fight for gender equality. We must #ChooseToChallenge the barriers that hold women back, today and every day.
https://t.co/C0wnMRspKt The #AmericanRescuePlan is key to winning the battle against COVID-19‚Äîdeploying more vaccines, getting kids back to school more quickly &amp; safely, and extending lifelines to those facing severe hardship. Read more about how this relief will help Marylanders:https://t.co/1juqz26Dfe Republican state legislators erecting barriers to voting are today‚Äôs equivalent of the Alabama troopers who beat John Lewis and others 56 yrs. ago. We must stop them. Biden‚Äôs EO is the first step, but we must pass #HR1 &amp; the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. #BloodySunday It doesn‚Äôt get any clearer than this. Maryland is failing our Black communities. It's ranked among the worst in the nation when it comes to the share of Black residents who have been vaccinated. There‚Äôs no excuse for falling this far behind. It must change.https://t.co/Q1CshXKRsq The Senate just passed the American Rescue Plan. 

This sweeping package is exactly what we need to defeat the virus and support our working families, small businesses, and communities. 

The American people called for action.

Today we answered that call. Lots of coffee and a little ragged, but more determined than ever to pass this bill to defeat the pandemic and help folks get back on their feet. The #AmericanRescuePlan contains the bold relief that our nation desperately needs. Republicans just moved to adjourn but we won‚Äôt quit on the American people. We will stay as long as it takes to get this done. https://t.co/tmcK5Jwa6C Scammers have turned the pandemic into another way to take advantage of Americans. Today @BrianFrosh and I discussed how to avoid common scams and what the American Rescue Plan does to protect Marylanders.
https://t.co/RDyntYtGGk Today marks one year since MD's 1st confirmed cases of COVID-19. Over the last year, thousands of our neighbors have lost their lives, livelihoods, and loved ones to this virus. But we‚Äôve also worked to lift each other up. Together, we'll weather this storm and build back better. Welcome @VP call with our Israeli partners on their successful vaccination program and importance of our scientific cooperation. Place to start is to use Israel‚Äôs excess vaccine supplies to ensure Palestinians in West Bank and Gaza have access to vaccines.
https://t.co/hgHkQBPvGQ Our nation must address injustice and systemic racism in all its forms. The House took a key step in the area of law enforcement by passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The Senate must follow suit and also urgently address other deep racial inequities in our society. Can't make this up. What outrages the GOP? 

Not domestic terrorism, extreme inequality, gun violence, or racial injustice.

Nope. The GOP is ‚Äúoutraged‚Äù about making it easier for Americans to vote! https://t.co/up74844cUU With GOP lawmakers working to reduce voting accessibility and corporations pumping more money than ever into elections, it‚Äôs long past time for serious election reform. The House has done its job in passing the #ForThePeople Act today, and now the Senate must act. https://t.co/78GKTJpOJZ Good to meet with @POTUS, @VP, and a bipartisan group to brainstorm how we take a quantum leap forward to beat devastating diseases like cancer and Alzheimer‚Äôs. We must leverage the scientific power we‚Äôve seen in the development of COVID-19 vaccines by experts like those at @NIH. MD¬†has strong gun laws but¬†it's¬†not an island. Many illegal guns come from other states‚Äîbringing with them a higher death toll on our streets. Glad to see @MayorBMScott and Baltimore join with @Everytown on this¬†new tool¬†to save lives, and I‚Äôll keep fighting for national reforms. https://t.co/Gcq7bHsaE5 Americans need a living wage and they need it now. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm cosponsoring @SenSanders‚Äô amendment to add our increase of the minimum wage back to the American Rescue Plan. We will keep fighting for this at every turn until we get it done. 
https://t.co/hxsCd68IbH The pandemic's economic fallout has hit women particularly hard. Nearly 2.4 million women have left the workforce since February 2020. As we mark #WomensHistoryMonth, it‚Äôs incumbent on us to win the fight for gender equality‚Äîin the workplace and everywhere.https://t.co/SWCkQwbjpT The numbers don‚Äôt lie. Communities of color simply do not have equitable access to vaccines in Maryland right now. We must change that. Tune in to our roundtable today to discuss how the state can tackle these inequities. https://t.co/RCuqiHWYAh Gun violence has plagued too many families in Maryland and across the country. Universal background checks will save lives. Our bill is a common-sense, effective way to keep weapons out of dangerous hands. It‚Äôs time to get it done. https://t.co/BgwbWdXfcT Frank B. Coakley was a great Marylander and a pillar of Baltimore. After founding @IPT1963 at Morgan State, he built an illustrious career in community lending &amp; fought his whole life for civil rights. My thoughts are with his family &amp; all his loved ones.
https://t.co/snqlrfTfwh This is an ominous sign that the Supreme Court will not stand up to defend voting rights and makes the passage of the For the People Act (#HR1) an even more urgent priority.
https://t.co/NTeDJCwQdY The U.S. must not sit on its hands as Putin attempts to murder his opposition and crush voices for democracy. Trump did nothing, but glad to see @POTUS take these steps in response to actions against @navalny and those seeking greater freedoms. https://t.co/m7mmPMo15g 60 years ago, JFK established the @PeaceCorps. Since then, more than 235,000 Americans have served in over 140 countries. Our world has changed dramatically, but the Peace Corps' vision of volunteerism and global community remains vital and necessary today. #PeaceCorpsWeek Here we go again. A right-wing group‚Äî100% funded by dark money‚Äîis attacking Biden's top DOJ nominees. What are they worried about? Their stellar records in advancing justice and civil rights?

We need to get dark money out of politics now! 
https://t.co/UFx807SBWF Disabled veterans deserve full retirement benefits. Our bill‚Äînamed after its fiercest advocate, the late Major Richard Star‚Äîwould help ensure that more than 42,000 combat-injured veterans get the compensation they‚Äôve earned.
https://t.co/6gymVJyfVE A year ago Trump called COVID-19 a ‚Äúhoax.‚Äù Then came his Big Lie and the mob attacks on January 6th. Now he is making up for lost time, breaking even his previous records for number of lies per minute. Scary part is so many Republican senators continue to cower to him. Biden Administration must act quickly to use maximum authorities in the bipartisan #HongKong Autonomy Act, enacted last July, to punish officials involved in China‚Äôs continuing crackdown on freedom and democracy there. 
https://t.co/DcSGP0Pf9u After years of pushing, the SEC is moving to focus on the financial risks of climate change. We have to use all levers to #ActOnClimate, &amp; investors should have info on how corporations contribute to climate change‚Äîand be able to choose less risky options.
https://t.co/uh6d79qA61 Providing Americans access to fast and reliable internet at home can‚Äôt wait. After fighting to include this provision in the last COVID relief package, I‚Äôm glad to see the FCC act quickly to help families get online.
https://t.co/AgSyoikUUD Americans should not be robbed of a living wage by archaic Senate rules and procedures‚Äîincluding the filibuster. We must increase the minimum wage, and I‚Äôll keep pushing until we get it done. https://t.co/ymfS056bux It's now official: MBS ordered the murderous operation against Jamal Khashogghi. Those who implemented this order can be sanctioned, but that won't address the full need for accountability‚Äîor prevent this from happening again. We cannot go back to business as usual. https://t.co/KjbsVAZhJB I discussed with @JohnBKing &amp; @NFLTE82 how #CommunitySchools address students‚Äô needs both inside &amp; outside the classroom to set them up for success. That‚Äôs why I teamed up with @SenSherrodBrown &amp; @SenGillibrand to reintroduce the #FSCSExpansionAct to invest in community schools. https://t.co/1iSpZtiEuR Our new Energy Secretary @SecGranholm gets that combatting the climate crisis is also an opportunity to create millions of American jobs and is ready to lead our energy sector in making this goal a reality. Glad to vote in support of her nomination today.
https://t.co/2oJ6zCudLK Marylander Cynthia Murray puts in 32 hours a week at the Walmart she‚Äôs worked at for 20+ years. She makes less than $15 an hour and struggles to make ends meet. While our state‚Äôs minimum wage will gradually increase to $15, that‚Äôs not the case elsewhere. It‚Äôs time to act. https://t.co/bqEgcIHlrs Special interests are infecting our democracy, disempowering voters and leaving them in the dark. The public has a right to know who is paying billions to influence their vote. We passed the #DISCLOSE Act in the House years ago, but McConnell blocked it. Time to get this done! Big news: The House just passed the #EqualityAct. This bill is a critical step toward finally enshrining protections for LGBTQ Americans in federal law. Let‚Äôs get this passed in the Senate and over to @POTUS to be signed into law! https://t.co/gqyGESwKd2 The truth is finally coming out on the Saudi government‚Äôs assassination of U.S. resident and journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. In Trump‚Äôs America you could literally get away with murder in return for presidential flattery. Thankfully we are turning the page on that dark time. https://t.co/QcoWfn8iUe Bringing new leaders onto the Board of Governors is a step in the right direction. Next step must be to get rid of Louis DeJoy. I look forward to confirming these qualified nominees so they can help restore the timely delivery of Americans‚Äô mail.
https://t.co/eiT8jrRWIO Our public education system has faced underinvestment for decades, exacerbating inequities. As we mark #BlackHistoryMonth and #PublicSchoolWeek, I‚Äôll be answering questions from Baltimore student, Jemira Queen, alongside @JohnBKing and @NFLTE82 about this. https://t.co/YdzGdRTszf Those attacking Haaland, Becerra, and Tanden didn't blink an eye at Trump picks like Tom ""Private Planes"" Price; Andrew ""King of the Coal Lobby"" Wheeler; Ryan ""What-Montana-Land-Deal"" Zinke ‚Äîand the list goes on.
 
What is it about qualified appointees that scares them? Our campaign finance system is broken. Special interests pour millions into our elections, stifling the people's voice. @SenatorLujan, @RepDavidEPrice, @RepDerekKilmer and I are introducing bills to empower small-dollar donors and ensure the @FEC is a true watchdog. https://t.co/3xCNpqSfmf Tomorrow I‚Äôm hosting a discussion on educational equity with Baltimore high schooler Jemira Queen, @NFLTE82, and @JohnBKing. Tune in live here 6PM ET. https://t.co/Mcu1SK22F8 MD Dept. of Health now recognizes we need a statewide registration system like those in other states. But we also need to expand beyond mass sites to help MDers better access vaccines &amp; move MD up from the bottom of the pack. This may be a step forward but we need a giant leap. https://t.co/1C6mjFgIAC Following four years of retreat, we must work overtime to restore our leadership on the global stage. That includes at the @UN, and I know @LindaT_G is the right person for it. I look forward to working with her as we rebuild our alliances and invest in diplomacy. After four long years, we finally have a President willing to hold Putin accountable for attacks on our infrastructure and for his assault on freedom and democracy. https://t.co/xn5LZDU2hS At a time when many struggle to pay rent and put food on the table, it‚Äôs unconscionable that some hospitals seize patients‚Äô wages and bank accounts to collect medical debts. I‚Äôm reintroducing legislation to ban this practice that can leave families destitute during a pandemic. https://t.co/RbbAEFDSu6 I felt a weight lifting from my shoulders today as I introduced the President's nominee for Attorney General, Merrick Garland. After years of an Attorney General who did the personal political bidding of Donald Trump, Judge Garland is the antidote the country needs. https://t.co/NmlkwyS0IG Alliances and effective diplomacy make America stronger and safer. It‚Äôs good to finally see a leader in the White House who will actually work with, not against, our NATO allies.
https://t.co/ajVEJfTknV Texas is learning that the devastation wrought by climate change is not a thing of the future‚Äîbut of here and now. Today the U.S. rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, re-engaging with the world to fight this crisis. Let‚Äôs get to work to create millions of clean energy jobs! https://t.co/T9BmcyinHs This is excellent news! I‚Äôve valued @JulieVerratti‚Äôs insights on how best to support small businesses, and I‚Äôm certain she will be a fierce advocate for those in Maryland and all across our country. Congratulations Julie‚Äîthe Biden Administration is lucky to have you! https://t.co/qdDnu1G7E1 Gun violence exacts a terrible toll, but the agency charged with enforcing our gun laws hasn't had a permanent Director for 6 years. We're urging @POTUS to quickly nominate an @ATFHQ Director to prioritize transparency, industry oversight, and gun safety.
https://t.co/jz9P9yapnp The Trump climate change deniers tried to bury the evidence. Glad to see the Biden Admin putting science back into the decision-making process. With this step, agencies will set an example for the rest of the nation by weighing the costs of carbon pollution before taking action. https://t.co/y8elejEFtI Let us know what you find! And congratulations to the good folks at @NASAJPL, @NASA, and @JHUAPL whose hard work keeps our nation at the forefront of space discovery and innovation. https://t.co/Z5loJHehji Spot on, @genebsperling. For years, we‚Äôve been fighting to cut taxes for working families by boosting the Earned Income and Child Tax Credits. By expanding both, the American Rescue Plan will help cut childhood poverty and get relief to those hardest-hit.https://t.co/vvwDyhpt8Z The #USCitizenshipAct marks an important step. Proud to cosponsor this bill to provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and TPS recipients. We've pushed for years to reform our immigration system so it reflects our nation‚Äôs values‚Äîlooking forward to continuing that work. Right now, there are loopholes that can allow corporate executives to game the system and profit off of insider information. I‚Äôve introduced a bill with @SenatorFischer to fix this and recently teamed up with @SenWarren and @SenSherrodBrown to ask the SEC to review their rules. https://t.co/xU5OoJ0sbc Some great news in news! This is a win for Baltimore, the Sun employees, and journalism in Maryland. Glad to see the Sun back in the hands of the community.  
https://t.co/0ewB5ew3rv Now more than ever, it‚Äôs critical for Americans to have health care coverage‚Äîwhich is why the Biden Administration has announced a special open enrollment period for uninsured Americans to get covered from now until May 15th. Sign up at https://t.co/snisPkKboe. Today I hosted a roundtable with @CharlesSydnor3d, @JheanelleW, and affordable housing advocates to discuss the COVID-19 housing crisis and what we‚Äôre doing to help. If you missed it, watch here: https://t.co/p7piE2xxRl https://t.co/YkCIWjZhJB Reports that North Korea is attempting to steal COVID-19 vaccine information from Pfizer are deeply concerning. I‚Äôm planning to reintroduce legislation with @SenSasse to sanction foreign entities who steal our cutting-edge technologies and key innovations. https://t.co/wgng9fYVtc This #PresidentsDay we are especially grateful for what we had taken for granted until the 2020 election‚Äîthe peaceful transfer of power. January 6th was a wakeup call. We must be vigilant to protect Lincoln‚Äôs exhortation that ‚Äúgovernment by the people...shall not perish.‚Äù Because of the incredible work federal employees at NIH and FDA do, we were able to develop the COVID-19 vaccine in record time. As @POTUS noted during his visit to NIH, these folks are heroes and represent the best our nation has to offer. Maryland could not be more proud. https://t.co/jblhbHk6Kl This trial proved Trump‚Äôs high crimes against the Constitution. 43 senators put Trump first and failed the test of history. But history was also made with the largest bipartisan majority ever voting to convict a president. The rest of the story is ours to write. This is unacceptable. Trump may have left office, but his Postmaster General is still wreaking havoc even after the Congress just provided the Post Office with an additional $10 billion. He must be replaced.
https://t.co/SxyiA1IKdX Congrats @NAACP on your 112th anniversary! We salute your tireless work in the long struggle to ensure our country‚Äôs actions meet the promise of equal rights, equal justice, and equal opportunity for all. #NAACPFoundersDay The Senate just passed our resolution awarding Officer Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal for his bravery and quick thinking during the attack on our Capitol. His actions saved lives and protected our democratic process. I urge the House to swiftly follow suit. Maryland Proud. There‚Äôs nothing more important than investing in our children‚Äôs success. Implementing the Blueprint for MD‚Äôs Future will help provide EVERY child with a quality education. Working with Biden Admin to match these efforts by passing the Keep Our PACT to fully fund Title I &amp; IDEA. #Demirtas, the leader of Turkey‚Äôs third largest political party, has been in jail for over four years. Turkey has continued to ignore the European Court of Human Rights' rulings that both his and Kavala‚Äôs detentions were unlawful. Welcome @StateDept‚Äôs call for the release of imprisoned Turkish civil society leader Osman Kavala. Trump should have done this long ago.¬†We also shouldn‚Äôt forget the thousands of Turkish citizens unjustly imprisoned‚Äîincluding former Presidential candidate, Selahattin #Demirtas. https://t.co/OxuWUxBza9 We must reduce the costs of prescription drugs so Marylanders can afford the medications they need. Today‚Äôs override vote means the new Prescription Drug Affordability Board can help do just that. Congress also needs to do its part, including by passing the We PAID Act. https://t.co/FsVdmeKjrc Even if you somehow conjure up the fiction that Trump didn‚Äôt know what he was doing when he started the Big Lie, there is no defense for why he refused to stop the violence after repeated calls from both Democrats and Republicans. To GOP senators: vote for our democracy. https://t.co/OJiKXM4eiO Access to housing is a human right. It cannot and should not be denied to anyone based on who you love. Today, the Biden Administration took a long overdue step to help ensure that by extending the protections of the Fair Housing Act to LGBTQ Americans. Glad to see this progress. What‚Äôs ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù is watching Capitol Hill police being beaten and spat upon by the mob Trump sent to overturn an election and what‚Äôs ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù is the failure to conclude that Trump‚Äôs actions are a crime against the Constitution. https://t.co/ultUIOTlai Even virtually, the athletes and advocates at @SpOlympicsMD never fail to inspire! It was great to discuss how Congress can best support the @SpecialOlympics so we can work together to build inclusive communities and fight for the rights of those with disabilities. https://t.co/IlcNnsplKK Good news from Biden Administration this week: more vaccines doses are coming to the states. But everyone needs to work together on this issue. The CDC numbers don‚Äôt lie‚ÄîMaryland needs a more transparent and efficient process to get more vaccines to people. https://t.co/SFValwBXHE Today I discussed the need to go big on COVID-19 relief with @POTUS nominee for OMB Director @neeratanden. She made it clear: the risk of doing too little is far greater than the risk of doing too much. We must act quickly to defeat the virus and help Americans get back to work. https://t.co/1DM7YampWv Proud of my Congressman, @RepRaskin, for his powerful words today. The question he posed will haunt this trial to the end: will the Senate‚Äôs verdict show our children that our democracy is secure, our Constitution protected, and our Capitol safe? Measures to address Maryland's inadequate UI system are badly needed. Thank you @SenBillFerg and @SpeakerAJones for leading the charge to fix the problems at the Maryland Dept. of Labor and help thousands in our state.
https://t.co/xOjXQWRHzX Despite shortages in supplies‚Äîand repeated calls from Congress‚ÄîTrump refused to effectively¬†utilize the Defense Production Act to get our communities the resources they need. Glad to see @POTUS fully employ¬†this law to boost the production of vaccines and protective equipment. https://t.co/CbLfBhJTGN Congrats to fellow Marylander, @DenisMcDonough, on his confirmation to serve as our next Sec. of Veterans Affairs. As a former White House Chief of Staff, he knows how to solve tough problems, break down bureaucratic silos, and deliver results. He will serve our veterans well. #TPS recipients are our neighbors, colleagues, and frontline workers during the pandemic. Many have lived here legally for decades. We need to end the cruel uncertainty and pass the #SECUREAct now. https://t.co/YY9mumk8EG Sharon McMahan of Baltimore lost 6 relatives, including her son, to gun violence. We can honor survivors like Sharon &amp; so many others by taking action to save lives and pass commonsense gun measures. Gun rights shouldn‚Äôt trump human rights. #GVSurvivorWeek
https://t.co/FgapBUxv8W Investing in green energy will help tackle the climate crisis and generate millions of new jobs to put more green into workers' pockets. That‚Äôs why @SenMarkey and I are reintroducing our plan to accelerate clean energy deployment and working with the Biden team to get it done. https://t.co/tAnR84uEzQ As @WHCOS points out, the economic rescue must be big enough to address chronic long-term unemployment. My plan with @RonWyden and @SenatorBaldwin supports targeted mandatory funding to put the long-term unemployed back to work with the skills and support they need to stay there. https://t.co/YmMQ94Dqik We're the only industrialized nation without a national paid leave program. As workers and families struggle through COVID-19, the urgent need to act is clear. No one should have to choose between their health, their family, and their paycheck. It‚Äôs time to pass the #FAMILYAct. There are plenty of things to worry about during this pandemic, but our ability to use the postal system to pay bills or get prescriptions shouldn't be one of them. Congress provided funding to fix these problems.  Postmaster Gen. DeJoy must step up to the plate and do his job. https://t.co/TI9anK04Bn Throughout this pandemic, I‚Äôve heard from Maryland restaurants that are struggling to stay afloat. These local restaurants are vital to our communities and our economy‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I voted to get them the support they need. Glad the bipartisan RESTAURANTS Act amendment passed. Good news. It's been nearly two years since the Senate passed not one but two bipartisan resolutions to end U.S. military assistance to this brutal war that has led to so much suffering and civilian loss of life. Elections matter!  https://t.co/dSog8lUHsq We need to go big, before it‚Äôs too late‚Äîso we can beat this virus, get help to those hardest-hit, and put our economy back on the road to recovery. We need relief that meets this moment and the budget resolution we‚Äôre working to pass today will ensure that.https://t.co/GsPyGwcMRo The CDC ranks Maryland's vaccine distribution effort amongst the worst in the nation. People are frustrated and confused. We are pressing for answers‚Äîbecause families are badly in need of a clearer vaccine distribution plan to protect their loved ones and save lives. https://t.co/I6tEE9rFIm Early this morning, I paid my respects to Officer Brian Sicknick. The Capitol Police are the sentries for our democracy, and Officer Sicknick lost his life in service of this mission. We owe him and his family a debt we can never fully repay. We must never forget his sacrifice. https://t.co/14Ga1fRFXI With the #GreenNewDeal &amp; smart policies, we can achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. A new @theNASEM report confirms: with policies like cap &amp; dividend and the clean energy accelerator @SenMarkey &amp; I just introduced, we can make this goal a reality. 
https://t.co/kACK7S7PEA This isn‚Äôt how anybody should be treated, let alone a 9-year-old. This awful incident highlights the need for those trained in mental health, not use of force, to respond to this kind of emergency. We must pass the Community-Based Response Act, my bill with @RepKarenBass. https://t.co/CzxhCZW1FW On June 17, 2018, at a Texas Detention Center, I listened to parents recount having their children torn from their arms. I will never forget it. Trump‚Äôs family separation policy is a dark mark on our history, and I‚Äôm glad @POTUS is acting to reunite the families still impacted. https://t.co/zKobhKs9zq Students from low-income families shouldn't have to struggle to participate in online classes because of slow internet speed. We will continue to push Comcast and work with the @FCC to do much better. Access to learning should not depend on the size of your pocketbook. https://t.co/fqw1Zn1PQt Not only is @AliMayorkas regarded as one of the most knowledgeable homeland security experts in our nation, he's also widely known for his work to protect immigrant communities, including Dreamers and TPS recipients. I know he will work to address the challenges at DHS head-on. News flash: you can‚Äôt falsely yell ‚Äúfire‚Äù in a crowded movie theater and the First Amendment doesn't protect incitement of insurrection either.
https://t.co/kXFeAbLmh3 Putin failed to kill @navalny with chemical nerve agents. He's failed to snuff out the voices of the throngs of Russians in the streets demanding democracy. Trump always sided with Putin over the people. Glad Biden is doing the reverse. You can't lock up the demand for freedom. It's official. It's Secretary Pete now! Congratulations to our new Transportation Secretary, @PeteButtigieg on his historic confirmation. Look forward to working with him to modernize our infrastructure, create jobs, tackle climate change and build back better for all Americans. If Trump‚Äôs new impeachment defense focuses on perpetuating his Big Lie, then Senate Republicans will have to vote either to endorse QAnon and the Big Lie or to convict him for his blatantly seditious conduct. Any bets? Well put, @RichardTrumka. John Sweeney dedicated his life to the labor movement and helped improve the lives of millions of workers. His legacy will not be forgotten as we continue his fight for living wages, paid leave, union protections, worker safety, and immigration reform. https://t.co/ICDMEFLVp4 During #BlackHistoryMonth we honor the legacy and sacrifice of those who have advanced the long struggle for justice and equality. That struggle must be ours as we work to achieve real change and ensure our nation finally lives up to the promise of liberty and justice for all. Here‚Äôs the bottom line‚Äîto combat this pandemic we need action that meets the moment. This is urgent and we can‚Äôt slow down or go small. https://t.co/Z4U0HiIfe0 For many families, securing their next meal is full of uncertainty.

Housing impacts every corner of our lives &amp; we cannot afford to leave any GA family behind. I‚Äôm proud to introduce new legislation to study disparities in service benefits for veterans of color. The pandemic has further illuminated &amp; exacerbated racial inequities in health care, &amp; this bill will help us identify &amp; address systemic challenges veterans of color face.

(2/2) It wasn‚Äôt the people or workers of GA who crafted SB 202‚Äîit was politicians seeking to retain power at the expense of Georgians' voices. And today‚Äôs decision by @MLB is the unfortunate consequence of these politicians‚Äô actions. (1/2) My heart is heavy following the death of another U.S. Capitol police officer, and my thoughts are with their loved ones.

I‚Äôm thankful for the quick response at the scene, and pray for an urgent, active peace across our nation that brings an end to this senseless violence. According to new data from the @BrennanCenter, there are now 361 voter suppression bills filed across the United States. 

This is a full-on attack to limit access to the ballot box nationwide. I‚Äôm going to do everything in my power to ensure Congress passes voting rights. The recent unabashed attempts to restrict &amp; limit access to the ballot box here in Georgia are not the first &amp; certainly won‚Äôt be the last. It‚Äôs time for Congress to step up &amp; pass the John Lewis #VotingRightsAct &amp; the For the People Act &amp; restore the voice of the people. https://t.co/SesjAS2DQY Alongside @RepHankJohnson, I‚Äôm urging @HHSgov to review discrepancies in data surrounding COVID-19 deaths in Georgia nursing homes. We owe greater transparency to Georgia‚Äôs seniors and their loved ones‚Äîand we need clear, accurate data to overcome the pandemic once and for all. https://t.co/JZnV5edfo3 This pandemic has exacerbated longstanding inequities in our health care system, a system that often falls short for communities of color. As we kick off #NationalMinorityHealthMonth, we must commit to closing these gaps &amp; ensuring every Georgian has access to health care. My friend @SenAlexPadilla is absolutely right. In Georgia, Black women are *6 times* more likely to die due to childbirth complications. It‚Äôs past time we ensure all families can access safe, affordable &amp; unbiased maternal health care. https://t.co/uSoVp782gy One of the best parts of the job is coming home to GA &amp; meeting with folks around the state. Yesterday, I traveled across SW GA to learn more about the tremendous work being done by our farmers &amp; producers‚Äîthank you for welcoming me with your generosity &amp; hospitality. https://t.co/nTqEIUwqNQ My friend John Lewis used to say the right to vote is sacred. Now, less than a year after his death, there are hundreds of voter suppression bills being introduced nationwide. We must protect his legacy &amp; pass the #VoterEmpowermentAct &amp; the #ForThePeopleAct now. https://t.co/r8DNI0RWgr Be sure to catch @ChrisCuomo &amp; me tonight at¬†around 9:30 PM ET on @CNN, where¬†we will be discussing my stops around GA discussing the #AmericanRescuePlan &amp; the recent attack on voting rights in Georgia &amp; across the nation. On #TransDayOfVisibility‚Äîand every day‚ÄîI stand with Georgia's trans community. I see you and I will always fight for you. Every single person deserves respect, dignity and the opportunity to be their authentic self. As a member of @SenateAgDems, I am committed to supporting Georgia‚Äôs agricultural economy‚Äîand ensuring those Georgia farmers and producers that put food on the table have a seat at the table. Our state and nation are dependent on you and your important work. https://t.co/y7nFYiG7t4 Today, alongside Rep. @SanfordBishop, I toured SW Georgia &amp; met with folks who have kept our Georgia families fed amid a pandemic. I am thankful for the chance to listen &amp; learn more about the incredible operations they are running day to day. https://t.co/73On6wMtyY Georgia is at the forefront of agriculture. From peanutsü•úto peachesüçë, our state leads the way. I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to hear firsthand from Georgia producers &amp; farming families about what they‚Äôre doing &amp; how I can assist at the federal level. https://t.co/5LgSSeSCBh The #AmericanRescuePlan is helping farmers &amp; rural communities across Georgia combat the COVID-19 pandemic:
 
üåΩBillions for USDA to help alleviate supply chain issues
üåΩ$500M in emergency grants for rural health care
üåΩLevels the playing field for farmers of color I‚Äôm excited to kick off today‚Äôs agricultural tour across SW Georgia with my friend &amp; colleague, @SanfordBishop‚Äîhighlighting what the #AmericanRescuePlan will bring to Georgia‚Äôs farmers &amp; rural communities! We cannot afford to have our democracy hi-jacked. This is bigger than one person or an election‚Äîthe very foundation of our nation is under attack. 
 
We must pass voting rights no matter what. https://t.co/iunQ8Zi2I6 I want to recognize all the incredible doctors across GA who have been working tirelessly the past year to help us beat the COVID-19 pandemic. I know I speak on behalf of all Georgians when I say thank you so much for your dedication to GA &amp; our country. #NationalDoctorsDay When Georgians made their voices heard in January, they made it possible for the #AmericanRescuePlan to become law. I‚Äôm glad to be home in Georgia talking about what we delivered to help folks across the state navigate the pandemic. https://t.co/8fM45jCYTU The #AmericanRescuePlan helped GA secure millions to strengthen vaccine distribution efforts statewide. Today, with @MayorJohnsonSAV, I toured the Gulfstream vaccination site in Savannah to see the hard work being done to get shots in arms &amp; allow us to safely begin to reopen. https://t.co/dvXYK5Q0By Today, I met with the Chatham Savannah Authority for the Homeless to learn more about what they‚Äôre doing to combat this injustice in my hometown. I appreciate the important work they‚Äôre doing &amp; it‚Äôs crystal clear the only solution for homelessness is ensuring housing. 2/2 https://t.co/LzvCKzq0MT Housing is an issue very close to my heart &amp; I firmly believe everyone should be able to live in dignity with a roof over their head. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated homelessness across Georgia‚Äîincluding¬†for our veteran communities. 1/2 https://t.co/LW5FmIyl8c As we round out #WomensHistoryMonth, I want to recognize the countless women in Georgia who are fighting to protect access to the ballot box‚Äîpast, present &amp; future. Thank you for your willingness to stand up &amp; fight tirelessly for our democracy. I‚Äôve said it before &amp; I‚Äôll say it again: housing is health care‚Äîespecially during a pandemic. I‚Äôm glad to see important steps being taken to keep Georgia's families safely housed.
https://t.co/vZgBu4yEdz What happened in Georgia with SB 202 wasn‚Äôt an isolated incident‚Äîwe have been seeing an uptick in voter suppression bills nationwide. We must fight back &amp; pass the John Lewis #VotingRightsAct &amp; the For the People Act now.
https://t.co/DmYUFEzKxM In the past year, we have lost over 18,000 Georgians to COVID-19. As we mourn and remember those lost too soon, let‚Äôs all commit to safely doing our part to help beat this pandemic. Glad to be in Savannah today talking to local officials about how we can help get and keep people housed, as well as what‚Äôs being done on the ground to help our veterans experiencing homelessness and how the #AmericanRescuePlan will help families keep roofs over their heads. I couldn‚Äôt agree more, @POTUS. It‚Äôs past time we take the steps needed to cement our sacred right to the vote. https://t.co/Kv3SxNisF3 Hatred of any kind has no place in Georgia or our society‚Äîfull stop. 

In light of the March 16 tragedy in Atlanta, I introduced a bicameral resolution with my colleagues to condemn this plague of anti-Asian violence &amp; reaffirm our commitment to the AAPI community. #StopAsianHate https://t.co/5oM1bcHzWs Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the U.S.‚Äî&amp; the number is even higher for Black women. The Kira Johnson Act will ensure we take effective steps to curb this maternal health crisis &amp; expand access to affordable &amp; unbiased care. Had a great morning visiting Fort Gordon &amp; learning about the work being done right here in Georgia to strengthen our cyber defense capacity &amp; keep our national defense strong. Fort Gordon &amp; the Augusta community are integral parts of our national security infrastructure. https://t.co/7tFxH6T4nj I have news for Georgia‚Äîwe‚Äôre going to keep knocking on that door. We aren‚Äôt stopping until we have secured equal access to the ballot box for all eligible American voters. The fight isn't over &amp; I'm going to do everything in my power to protect the sacred right to vote. https://t.co/Y2XDSzAAPZ I‚Äôm excited to be in Augusta today to visit Fort Gordon &amp; talk about the big wins for Georgia in the #AmericanRescuePlan. From ramped up vaccination distribution to helping safely reopen schools to crucial investments in agriculture, we are going to get Georgia back on track! https://t.co/XROEwGikrN I‚Äôm proud my Emergency Relief for Farmers of Color Act made it into the #AmericanRescuePlan‚Äîit's going to make a difference for many farmers in GA‚Äîbut there is still much work ahead to do right by our farmers &amp; further strengthen American agriculture.¬†
https://t.co/xLJaV0fmb1 There are currently 250+ bills pending in 40+ states aiming to suppress the vote. 
 
Let me be clear‚Äîthe very foundation of our democracy is under attack. It‚Äôs time to pass the For the People Act &amp; expand the sacred right to the ballot box. Looking forward to joining @DanaBashCNN on #SOTU today‚Äîhope you can tune in! https://t.co/wJkfrOVTYj Wishing all who celebrate a happy &amp; joyful #Passover. I hope you find peace in safely sharing this time with loved ones.
¬†
May this season bring good health &amp; bountiful blessings. Chag Sameach! I‚Äôm so grateful to all the volunteers who have tirelessly worked to help keep Georgian families fed throughout this pandemic. Yesterday, I met with a group of volunteers in Marietta &amp; learned more about their tremendous efforts during this difficult time. https://t.co/snVfGiqvkl Tonight, around 9:20 PM ET, I‚Äôll be joining @Maddow to discuss the brazen attempt from some Georgia lawmakers to suppress voters. I‚Äôve made it very clear we are not going to back down. Be sure to tune in! It‚Äôs been a tough couple of weeks for Georgians &amp; my heart goes out to those impacted by the storms this morning in Newnan‚Äîas well as to our neighbors in Alabama who also experienced devastation. My staff &amp; I are available to assist families recovering in whatever way possible. When I‚Äôm home in Georgia, folks don‚Äôt want to talk about Senate procedures like the filibuster. They want to talk about voting rights, health care, education &amp; more.
 
It‚Äôs time the Senate stops safeguarding procedural relics that reek of Jim Crow &amp; starts working for the people. Georgia‚Äôs sweeping ‚Äúelection reform‚Äù bill isn‚Äôt about reforming elections‚Äîit‚Äôs about further suppressing the vote &amp; taking away the people's voice. This is democracy in reverse. Congress must act swiftly to secure voting rights &amp; every option must be on the table to do so. It‚Äôs been just over a week since the horrific tragedy in Atlanta that took eight lives too soon. As we mourn, we also must commit to standing up against anti-Asian rhetoric &amp; actions‚Äîwhich have risen rampantly throughout the pandemic‚Äî&amp; work toward an active peace. #StopAsianHate Decades later, Dr. King‚Äôs work is still unfinished. We must build upon his legacy &amp; fiercely protect our access to the ballot box. #TheVoteIsSacred https://t.co/e1R1h8FgNO Yesterday, on the anniversary of Dr. King &amp; activists arriving in Montgomery, my church member @Cannonfor58 was arrested for seeking transparency in gov‚Äôt. It‚Äôs abhorrent.
¬†
This democracy belongs to the people. We‚Äôre exhausted‚Äîwe‚Äôve been exhausted‚Äîbut we‚Äôre still fighting. Join me live as I discuss the events that unfolded last night‚Äîin what is a blatant attack on our democracy &amp; rights as Georgians.

I made a promise when I came to the Senate to never stop fighting for the sacred right to vote‚Äîno matter what. https://t.co/AEUrrHKsbH Instead of adjusting their message, some Georgia politicians have decided to rewrite the rules with SB 202‚Äîa thinly-veiled attempt to suppress the vote. It‚Äôs Jim Crow in new clothes.

We will not go back. And Congress must act to protect the sacred right to vote. Today in 1965, after a 5-day &amp; 54-mile march, activists led by Dr. King arrived in Montgomery to campaign for equal voting rights. A few months later, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 became law.¬†
¬†
Now, let's honor their commitment by passing the John Lewis #VotingRightsAct. I‚Äôm speaking on the Senate floor about the tremendous impacts of the Child Tax Credit &amp; Earned Income Tax Credit expansions in the #AmericanRescuePlan. We are on the path to eliminating childhood poverty once &amp; for all in Georgia &amp; across the nation.  https://t.co/A2tSBYam7t EXCITING NEWS: the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program extension is heading to @POTUS‚Äô desk to be signed into law. Georgia‚Äôs small businesses are central to local economies &amp; this extension will help them continue to weather this pandemic‚Äîhelp is just around the corner! I have often said the pandemic has only further exacerbated &amp; illuminated the longstanding disparities in our communities. As we begin the road to recovery, we must commit to not leaving any American behind.¬†
https://t.co/YNIN4nkN7W Yesterday, I was presented with the seal of the @USArmy &amp; reaffirmed my commitment to work hard on behalf of our servicemembers who are bravely serving at one of our 13 Army bases in Georgia, as well as across the nation &amp; abroad. Thank you for your service &amp; sacrifice! https://t.co/KKXqbadOGp Through the #AmericanRescuePlan, @USDA announced SNAP benefits will be increased by 15% through September 2021. We have seen an uptick in food stamps &amp; food insecurity during the pandemic &amp; no child should have to wonder where their next meal will come from. Senate rules cannot take priority over the very foundation of our democracy. It is past time to pass the John Lewis #VotingRightsAct and the For the People Act.
¬†
All options must be on the table in order to do so. On Thursday, March 25, all Georgians age 16 &amp; older will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.¬†
¬†
Make a plan today to get vaccinated &amp; do your part to help beat this pandemic. Senator Strom Thurmond dedicated 24 consecutive hours to filibustering the 1957 Voting Rights Act so people who look like me couldn‚Äôt vote.¬†
¬†
To say the filibuster doesn‚Äôt have a past rooted in racism is an appalling attempt to rewrite a very recent part of America's history. Last week, @SenOssoff &amp; I were joined by @POTUS &amp; @VP in Atlanta to mourn¬†the tragic loss of eight members of our community &amp; recommit to condemning hatred &amp; violence in all forms. I appreciate their continued leadership as we seek the light at the end of this dark chapter. https://t.co/pfIpC5Ipcw Equal work deserves equal pay.¬†
¬†
Unfortunately, women still have¬†to¬†work, on average, 80+ days into the new year to earn what their male counterparts did the year before. For women of color, this number is even higher. On #EqualPayDay, we must commit to closing the wage gap. Today, the @Senaterules committee is holding a hearing in support of the #ForThePeopleAct. We can no longer sit idly‚Äîit‚Äôs time to pass #S1 &amp; make sure our government is run by &amp; for the people, not politicians. https://t.co/w56BMTZjFb Georgia‚Äôs small businesses have worked tirelessly during the pandemic to keep their doors open‚Äînow it's our turn to ensure they can adequately access the resources &amp; relief needed to continue to stay open. https://t.co/QNIhxb7Ffc The¬†#AmericanRescuePlan¬†includes my Emergency Relief for Farmers of Color Act‚Äîaiding farmers whose livelihoods have been disproportionately harmed during this pandemic as a result of decades of discrimination &amp; injustice.¬†https://t.co/uXpkMTPbDP Everywhere you turn, there‚Äôs another attack on voting rights‚Äîfrom limiting weekend voting to curtailing ballot drop boxes to restricting absentee voting &amp; so much more.
¬†
Time is of the essence. We must pass the John Lewis #VotingRightsAct &amp; the For the People Act now. I‚Äôm proud to serve on @SenateAgDems‚Äîworking to ensure we do right by the folks who help to nourish &amp; sustain our nation. Today, on #NationalAgDay, let‚Äôs extend our thanks to those who have helped keep us fed¬†during this pandemic. Thank you!¬†üåΩüêÆüöú https://t.co/Xp8kaAJA41 Today, 11 years ago, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act‚Äîexpanding access to health care &amp; protecting millions of Americans.¬†We must expand Medicaid in our state to insure more Georgians as we continue to navigate this once-in-a-century pandemic. #ACA11 Today I met with @giladerdan1, Israel‚Äôs Ambassador to the United States, to discuss how we can continue to strengthen U.S.-Israel relations &amp; combat threats of anti-Semitism &amp; hate. https://t.co/S0P4RGuwet Have you heard? The #AmericanRescuePlan is going to cut childhood poverty in HALF.¬†
¬†
This hits home for me¬†&amp; generations of Georgians who grew¬†up struggling to make ends meet. This critical investment will help guarantee brighter &amp; healthier futures for our children nationwide. https://t.co/A6EGpXPdrg Not even a week after tragedy struck Atlanta, my heart breaks for our grieving brothers &amp; sisters in Boulder. 
 
As Dr. King said, hatred darkens life but love illuminates it. We must commit to being the love that lights the way out of these recent dark moments in our nation. The last time we reauthorized the 1965 Voting Rights Act, it passed the Senate 98-0.
¬†
Voting rights are bipartisan. I‚Äôm calling on my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support bolstering the very foundation of our democracy‚Äîthe right to vote. https://t.co/zmOf3JKimn 80 years ago, today, President Roosevelt activated the 99th Fighter Squadron‚Äîbetter known as the Tuskegee Airmen.
¬†
Today, we continue to honor¬†the patriotism¬†&amp; perseverance they showed¬†while¬†defending the United States in WWII as an all-Black aviation unit. https://t.co/VzjiHo9ya9 My Emergency Relief for Farmers of Color Act *is* COVID relief &amp; will help farmers who have been left behind for decades navigate this pandemic. Today, I joined @SenBooker,¬†@SenWarren¬†&amp; Black farmers¬†to further discuss this historic investment in agriculture. https://t.co/WUZFJAaQdg Rather than trying to change their message, some politicians are trying to change the rules to win elections.¬†
¬†
It cannot stand &amp; I will do everything in my power as a U.S. Senator to ensure equal opportunity to the ballot box. #TheVoteIsSacred
https://t.co/Z30ekLHdxu By denying D.C. a vote in Congress, we are denying people in our nation‚Äôs capital their full voice in our democracy. Today, House @OversightDems are holding a hearing on #DCStatehood‚Äîwasting no time to ensure 700,000+ residents have their voices heard. I‚Äôm proud my Emergency Relief for Farmers of Color Bill, included in the #AmericanResucePlan, will address long standing disparities faced by Black farmers¬†&amp; others¬†in GA &amp; across the country. But there is still much work to be done to ensure full equity &amp; justice. https://t.co/L0IGCzwhTv The #AmericanRescuePlan is putting dollars in pocket, shots in arms, cutting child poverty in half &amp; so much more.
 
Big &amp; bold legislation is what happens when we guarantee all eligible Americans equal opportunity to make their voices heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/AVDhwEOL4D Good morning! Looking forward to talking with @chucktodd about the urgent need to pass federal voting rights legislation, and what we must do in Georgia &amp; nationwide to #StopAsianHate on @MeetThePress. See you in a few minutes! https://t.co/LeXNIAgo9w Today marks 56 years since hundreds of brave men &amp; women began the historic march from Selma to Montgomery. 
 
1965 wasn‚Äôt that long ago‚Äîit feels even closer now with the ongoing attacks on voting rights in GA &amp; nationwide. The Senate must pass the John Lewis #VotingRightsAct. https://t.co/q10Uep2zo8 We all have a stake in each other‚Äôs wellbeing. I was glad to join the community in Atlanta with @SenOssoff today to remember &amp; honor the lives of those we lost in Tuesday‚Äôs shooting, and take an urgent stand to #StopAsianHate against our Asian-American brothers &amp; sisters. https://t.co/SaJ9WRKUlC Like Dr. King said, we‚Äôre all tied in a single garment of destiny. Thankful to @POTUS &amp; @VP for their words of hope in Atlanta yesterday and their commitment to condemning hate of all kinds.
¬†
As we remember those we lost, let us pray &amp; work for an active peace. #StopAsianHate https://t.co/BraSpMpuGD I joined the @BigTiggerShow yesterday to talk about the For the People Act &amp; the opportunity the Senate has to combat voter suppression &amp; expand access to the ballot box.
 
Your vote is your voice &amp; your voice is powerful. Never forget that. https://t.co/oLNHfexBfw At around 7:15 PM ET, I‚Äôll be on @thereidout to discuss the ongoing attacks on voting rights in Georgia &amp; the immediate actions the Senate can take to protect the ballot box. Hope you can join us! We must remember the names &amp; stories of the lives lost Tuesday‚Äîthey were parents, sisters, brothers, friends, neighbors, immigrants, veterans, hardworking people who brought joy &amp; love into this world. 
 
My heart continues to grieve with their families &amp; communities. https://t.co/rYvraUSRIa All options must be on the table to protect &amp; expand access to the ballot box. We must pass the John Lewis #VotingRightsAct &amp; the For the People Act. 
 
Democracy is bigger than the filibuster. Tuesday's tragedy culminates a horrendous year-long rise in anti-Asian incidents. This morning, I joined Georgia AAPI leaders for a roundtable to listen &amp; learn how we can be better advocates for our AAPI communities &amp; prevent future tragedies. #StopAsianHate https://t.co/kd1bez3sDe Only hate drives you to take eight precious lives. 
 
Right now, I‚Äôm more interested in learning about the members of our community we lost on Tuesday; I want to make sure we amplify their lives, their stories &amp; their humanity. https://t.co/Jy4piKbEuO One week ago, today, @POTUS signed the #AmericanRescuePlan‚Äîdelivering relief for millions in Georgia &amp; across the country.¬†Help is on the way! We are witnessing an unabashed assault on voting rights unlike anything we've seen since the era of Jim Crow.
 
This is just Jim Crow in new clothes.
 
It‚Äôs well past time to pass the John Lewis #VotingRightsAct &amp; the For the People Act.
https://t.co/AGccrFREQw As we navigate this pandemic, we must work together to improve the health &amp; well-being of all Americans. This is why I was proud to vote for @XavierBecerra as Secretary of @HHSGov. I‚Äôm confident in the leadership &amp; experience he will bring to find equitable solutions for all. Thank you @POTUS for your leadership in light of Tuesday's tragedy. I will continue to stand with the AAPI community &amp; Atlanta as we find the light at the end of this dark tunnel &amp; support the loved ones of those lost. We must stand up against hatred in all forms. #StopAsianHate https://t.co/5pvF57WRtw I‚Äôm incredibly proud to be a co-sponsor of the #ForThePeopleAct in the Senate alongside my friend, @SenJeffMerkley. From the east coast to the west coast, we are committed to protecting &amp; empowering all eligible voters. We must tackle voter suppression head on. https://t.co/T3ag1c8jBq My heart is with those in Atlanta‚Äîand across our state and nation‚Äîwho are grieving the loss of eight precious lives. We must condemn hatred and violence of all kinds and work toward finding peace in our hearts and in our communities. https://t.co/9DuZdeO7vN I know it‚Äôs early, but I hope you can join me this morning shortly before 7:45 AM ET as I catch up with @Morning_Joe to discuss the rampant voter suppression we‚Äôre seeing in Georgia &amp; what the Senate can do to combat this injustice. Grab your coffee &amp; start your day with us! Tonight, I‚Äôm joining @maddow a little after 9:15 PM ET to discuss the anti-democratic efforts in GA‚Äîand across the nation‚Äîto suppress the vote. I made clear on the Senate floor today Congress must take action to protect voting rights. Tune in! We owe it to our¬†civil¬†rights heroes, like the late Congressman John Lewis, to ensure all voices can be heard at the ballot box. By passing key voting rights legislation, such as the For the People Act, we can #ProtectTheVote for generations to come. #TheVoteIsSacred https://t.co/SBvyK1yAFK Today, in light of last night's horrific events, I am reminded of Dr. King‚Äôs message of driving out darkness with light; hate with love. I stand with the families grieving the loss of a loved one &amp; with Atlanta‚Äôs AAPI community. We will work through this tragedy together. As efforts to rollback critical voting rights and protections are growing in Georgia‚Äîand nationwide‚ÄîI‚Äôm speaking on the actions we can take in Congress to protect the foundation of our democracy &amp; ensure every single voice is heard. #TheVoteIsSacred https://t.co/qzTnJxuyIW I‚Äôm headed to the floor of the United States Senate now to give my first speech‚Äîdefending our sacred right as Americans to the ballot box. I hope you‚Äôll join me by tuning in via livestream here on Twitter or on Facebook. #TheVoteIsSacred https://t.co/da5Gd95Xq8 As I prepare to give my first speech on the Senate floor, I'm reminded I stand here on the shoulders of civil rights heroes like John Lewis. As Georgia's first African American Senator, I'm committed to protecting our sacred right to vote. We will not go back‚Äînot now, not ever. https://t.co/hJMAJZApO1 My heart grieves with the loved ones of the 8 people killed tonight. 

We cannot stop working together to drive out the hate that caused these senseless deaths. https://t.co/y0QxSPtDXK Housing is health care‚Äîespecially during a pandemic. I‚Äôm so proud of this effort in Atlanta to combat homelessness‚Äîand after the passage of the expansive COVID relief package, I‚Äôm glad more help is on the way to help Georgians keep roofs over their heads. 
https://t.co/Ou5ysiwhNB Small businesses all across Georgia have struggled to keep their doors open during the pandemic. The #AmericanRescuePlan is going to help Main Street get back on its feet by bolstering the Paycheck Protection Program, investing in finance programs &amp; extending grant options. This month, Georgia lawmakers voted on bills to curb absentee voting &amp; limit weekend voting. 
 
This is blatant voter suppression. It‚Äôs not restoring voter integrity‚Äîit's an attempt to cherry pick the electorate. The Senate must act now &amp; pass the For the People Act. Our children learn best when they‚Äôre in the classroom. 

The #AmericanRescuePlan is going to help Georgia students &amp; educators safely resume in-person learning by providing funding for PPE, contact tracing, ventilation system repairs &amp; more. https://t.co/yk4QFya1QG On Wednesday, March 17, at 12:45pm ET, I‚Äôll take the floor of the Senate to defend the very foundation of our democracy ‚Äì‚Äì the sacred right to vote.

I promise you, Georgia, I will never stop fighting to protect &amp; expand access to the ballot box. #TheVoteIsSacred https://t.co/xEO7L5Kq99 The #AmericanRescuePlan will:
¬†
üíâGet shots in arms
‚úèÔ∏èReopen schools safely
üè•Help¬†Georgians¬†get low-cost health care
üõ†Keep essential workers safe
‚ù§Ô∏èSlash childhood poverty in half
üí∏Put money in pockets
¬†
Thank you, Georgia‚Äîbecause of you we are going to beat this pandemic! https://t.co/BuWyhKRCDb Today would have been Justice Ruth Bader Ginburg‚Äôs 88th birthday. This #WomensHistoryMonth, we remember her lifelong dedication to breaking down barriers as she fought to make this country more equitable for all.¬†
¬†
We will continue this fight forward in her honor. Today, I was proud to vote to confirm @DebHaalandNM as Secretary of @Interior. Her confirmation makes her the first Native American to serve in the Cabinet, and I am confident she will be a strong and thoughtful steward of our public lands and resources. Today‚Äî56 years after President Johnson called for equal voting rights during a joint session of Congress‚Äîwe are still fighting for equal access to the ballot box.
 
Congress‚Äô work to protect equal voting rights isn‚Äôt done‚Äî&amp; we should start by passing the For the People Act. Voting rights are the foundation of our democracy. As we are seeing attacks on voting laws nationwide, it is past time for the Senate to pass the #VotingRightsAct &amp; the For the People Act. 
 
Every option must be on the table to ensure we protect access to the ballot box. #VRAA https://t.co/JnsJsDsB9T I know firsthand what it‚Äôs like to grow up and struggle to make ends meet‚Äîand I want to ensure we do better by our GA families. I‚Äôm proud of these provisions in the #AmericanRescuePlan that are taking critical steps to help eliminate childhood poverty. https://t.co/pN5ylFc7sg It‚Äôs been one year since we lost Breonna Taylor.¬†
¬†
We cannot forget her‚Äîor the countless other Black lives that have been so needlessly taken from us. We must continue to #SayHerName,¬†demand accountability &amp; take action against these tragic injustices.¬†#BlackLivesMatter Childhood poverty will be cut in half thanks to provisions in the #AmericanResucePlan designed to put money back in the pockets of working families. I was proud to talk today with GA mothers about how we‚Äôre pulling 170K+ GA kids  out of poverty &amp; fighting for their futures. https://t.co/XXrXjg1wKE The #AmericanRescuePlan will direct nearly $2B to expand Medicaid in GA‚Äîhelping ~500,000 Georgians secure the health care they need. Today, I met with folks at @EmoryHealthCare in DeKalb County &amp; the @LouWalkerCenter to hear first-hand what this critical investment means for GA. https://t.co/Z5lTAfidOL For too long, farmers of color have been left to face the dangers of climate change alone. As we tackle the climate crisis, I promise to work with @SenateAgDems to help historically-disadvantaged farmers implement effective climate solutions &amp; ensure equitable opportunities. https://t.co/beZYqRObNp Yesterday, @georgiapeanuts donated over 10,000 jars of peanut butter to @dcck‚Äîhelping combat hunger during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
This is what being a Georgian is all about‚Äîextending a hand to your neighbors in a time of need! #NationalPeanutMonth ü•ú The right to vote is at the very heart of who we are as American people.¬†
¬†
All options must be¬†on the table in order to successfully pass key legislation like the John Lewis #VRAA &amp; the For the People Act. We cannot delay a moment longer. https://t.co/sKBgwgoXGI 50 days ago, I was sworn into office just hours after @POTUS &amp; @VP. Since then we have worked to:

‚úÖcut child poverty in half
‚úÖstrengthen vaccine distribution
‚úÖget on track to reopen all our schools
‚úÖprovide aid to rural communities &amp; more

We‚Äôre just getting started, GA. I personally know the difference good policy makes when it‚Äôs aimed at helping working class families. The COVID relief bill¬†is going to help rebuild the middle class &amp; move us past this pandemic. I can't thank Georgia enough for making this possible.  https://t.co/JTHYaeDYZa"
"Warren, Elizabeth",SenWarren,ewarren,Massachusetts,Massachusetts,Senator," There are no winners in a nuclear war, and the US should never start one.

Today we remember the victims and survivors of the 2013 #BostonMarathon tragedy. And we also remember the strength that brought us together ‚Äì and the generosity of people across Massachusetts, the country, and around the world ‚Äì with #OneBostonDay. https://t.co/dWtPs9d5zZ Trump‚Äôs @usdol suggested that it would hand out a special favor to let @GoldmanSachs keep managing working families‚Äô retirement accounts, despite its imminent guilty plea in a billion-dollar scandal. @SenTinaSmith and I told the Biden admin: that‚Äôs not ok. https://t.co/0tUwmWO28x The GOP have starved the IRS to deplete its ability to catch wealthy tax cheats. IRS Commissioner Rettig and I agreed: additional mandatory funding would help the IRS enforce the tax laws for the ultra-rich already on the books. I‚Äôm working on legislation to do exactly that. https://t.co/0TmKEDglsY 5 million essential workers on the frontlines of the pandemic live in fear of deportation. @JoaquinCastrotx, @SenAlexPadilla, @RepTedLieu and I are urging the President to fix this injustice with a fair pathway to citizenship in his infrastructure plans. https://t.co/OUCKWBVHnm I strongly support President Biden‚Äôs decision to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan by September 11.

I told the CEO of PHEAA that @usedgov should fire them and we should #CancelStudentDebt to fix this utter failure. https://t.co/P4PSfyeIF8 The federal government should absolutely fire @Navient for illegally overcharging the government and trapping students in a rigged game. And because this happened under his leadership, Navient should fire Mr. Remondi. https://t.co/6dMHPGq8g7 Navient never gets fired for ripping off student borrowers and taxpayers ‚Äì @usedgov just keeps renewing their contract. I told the CEO of @Navient: we should #CancelStudentDebt to free millions of people from their traps and end the broken system making Navient profits. https://t.co/rl2Q3ItKjJ I'm glad we're talking about student debt at my first @SenateBanking subcommittee hearing. President Biden should #CancelStudentDebt to help close the racial wealth gap, jumpstart the economy, and expand opportunity for millions of Americans.

This is about economics and our values ‚Äì and I‚Äôm in this fight all the way. https://t.co/YGAaaLJamx Ramadan Mubarak! Wishing a peaceful and blessed month to Muslim families in Massachusetts, across the country, and around the world. New data from @usedgov show that canceling $50,000 of student loans would erase debt entirely for 84% of borrowers.

This fight in Alabama has made a real difference for workers across the country ‚Äì and it will make it easier for the next fight, and the fight after that, and the fight after that. The @BAmazonUnion workers have shown incredible courage to stand up and fight one of the world‚Äôs most powerful union-busting companies in one of the most anti-labor states in the country. https://t.co/ma1NW60rtq .@CDCgov is right: racism is a serious threat to public health. That‚Äôs why @RepBarbaraLee, @RepPressley and I have a bill to create an anti-racism center at the CDC. Thank you, @CDCDirector ‚Äì now it‚Äôs time to start attacking structural racism at its roots. https://t.co/kipSwhoGZK The stories of America‚Äôs families getting crushed by student loans hit like a punch to the gut. Canceling $50,000 of student loan debt will lift this burden entirely for most borrowers and make a huge dent for millions more. We must #CancelStudentDebt. https://t.co/5bCJVLS3q1 Great news that many people missed last week: @HUDgov is getting rid of the cruel Trump/Carson rule that would deny housing assistance to families with mixed immigration status. Never again should the federal government be working to make thousands of American children homeless. https://t.co/04ogkmUWPH Infrastructure is what makes all other work possible ‚Äì and if our mamas and daddies can‚Äôt work because they can‚Äôt find child care or long-term care for a parent, it hurts our families and our economy. Caregiving is basic infrastructure and we need bold investments in it. On #YomHaShoah, #WeRemember the 6 million Jews and millions of other people who were murdered during the Holocaust. We honor their memories by continuing to stand up to anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate and using every tool we have to defeat it. I was sworn in just weeks after Sandy Hook. I thought the Senate would listen to the American people and do something about gun violence. But year after year, tragedy after tragedy, the @SenateGOP keep working for the @NRA.

President Biden is right: the Senate must finally act. https://t.co/Wgl9WUpCE1 Giant corporations will whine, but let me be clear: we cannot bargain away tax loopholes for the world‚Äôs most profitable companies and starve our recovery just so the GOP can kiss their corporate donors' fannies. That's not a negotiation ‚Äì it‚Äôs a heist. This $2.5 trillion plan to enforce our tax laws and catch wealthy tax cheats is a good down payment to #BuildBackBetter ‚Äì but a #WealthTax on fortunes over $50 million would raise at least $3 trillion for America‚Äôs future. Let‚Äôs not nibble around the edges here. Raising the corporate tax rate alone isn‚Äôt enough when armies of lawyers and accountants help corporations pay a tiny fraction of that rate. We need a strong Real Corporate Profits Tax ‚Äì and not a watered-down version that lets more giant companies continue to pay zero taxes. Giant corporations that make billions of dollars in profits off the services that the rest of us pay for need to invest in America's future. Billionaires and giant corporations must pay a lot more. https://t.co/LXUe5eVMiw Just before Donald Trump left office, his team snuck in a rule to weaken the federal government‚Äôs ability to prevent price gouging of taxpayer-funded drugs. I joined @RepLloydDoggett in urging the Biden administration to stop this proposed rule. https://t.co/WWEdj9Y76c Housing is infrastructure. https://t.co/3sVE9gkzPH I‚Äôve spent years fighting these tax prep industry schemes to sabotage the Free File program.

I appreciate that he‚Äôs looking into it. America‚Äôs student borrowers need help. https://t.co/ajyJDeeZYY Millions of people can‚Äôt get long-term home and community-based care, &amp; the #AmericanJobsPlan makes big investments in these services through Medicaid. This is a good first step, &amp; we should also work to expand coverage of long-term care across the board. https://t.co/zcWYaws0xN The #ForThePeople Act will stop billionaires from buying elections. https://t.co/r5aRH36bp1 I fought for $50 billion to stabilize our child care system during COVID ‚Äì but it‚Äôs not enough to just stabilize a system that‚Äôs not working for many working moms. I‚Äôm fighting to fund long-term, structural changes to guarantee child care for every family.¬†https://t.co/2ySKOcLCps Working families and small businesses don‚Äôt have armies of lawyers, lobbyists, and accountants to hide their money overseas. We need a Real Corporate Profits Tax to level the playing field and make giant companies pay their fair share. https://t.co/4xM6uwiuLG The @NLRB has reportedly found merit that Amazon illegally retaliated against two more workers who spoke out about warehouse safety conditions. What we're seeing looks like a company-wide pattern of violating workers‚Äô rights ‚Äì and NLRB should investigate. https://t.co/2kUEdEyeKV I‚Äôm tired of the excuses made by corporate lobbyists about why ultra-millionaires and billionaires shouldn‚Äôt pay their fair share. The numbers are clear: it is time for a #WealthTax in America. https://t.co/tzBU349NHX Easter is a day of hope ‚Äì and this year I‚Äôm hopeful for healthier, happier days ahead. Wishing a safe and happy Easter to everyone celebrating in Massachusetts, across the country, and around the world. I‚Äôm heartsick for @CapitolPolice Officer Billy Evans, for his family, and for his hometowns of North Adams and Clarksburg. He was a true Massachusetts hero. https://t.co/NgKoc9iWYx My heart goes out to the loved ones of the officer killed at the Capitol today, the officer who remains hospitalized, and to the entire @CapitolPolice force who protect us every day. This is another tragedy. This isn‚Äôt rocket science: giant corporations that report billions in profit shouldn't be able to pay $0 in federal taxes. My Real Corporate Profits Tax ensures they can't wiggle out of paying a fair share. I‚Äôm glad President Biden included a version in the #AmericanJobsPlan. https://t.co/bvJvHKHpKa Canceling student loan debt is a matter of racial, economic, and generational justice. @RepPressley, @MassAGO Healey and I are urging President Biden to act. #CancelStudentDebt https://t.co/pLXYfNjRWU Thank you, @SecCardona, for meeting with @SenSchumer, @DerrickNAACP and me to talk about executive action to #CancelStudentDebt.

We must stand side-by-side with the AAPI community against bigotry and hate. https://t.co/h61CnDHPCq Canceling $50,000 of student loan debt will provide a massive stimulus to our economy, help narrow the racial wealth gap, and take a huge burden off of millions of struggling families. President Biden should use his authority to #CancelStudentDebt.  https://t.co/LzXkUlp5Ca Canceling student loan debt is one of the single most effective executive actions available to boost our economy, and it will help millions of people in MA and across the country. I‚Äôm joining @RepPressley and @MassAGO Healey right now to urge the President to #CancelStudentDebt. https://t.co/vY2JLsyBeS On this #TransDayOfVisibility, I want every trans and non-binary person to know: you are valued and loved. And we will not stop fighting to make sure that you can be who you are equally, openly, and safely. The MA fishing and seafood industries are critical to our economy, and these essential workers have been hit hard by this crisis. @NOAA just announced that it's sending MA another $23 million in COVID relief, and I'll keep fighting for the federal support our fisheries need. I was happy to join New Bedford Mayor @JonMitchellNB at the new waterfront vaccination center, which will focus on our fishermen and seafood processing workers. We spoke about the $3.9 million that @GNBCHC is receiving in the #AmericanRescuePlan to support this important work. https://t.co/ymZllD7MZM The #AmericanJobsPlan is a game-changer and full of ideas that progressives like me are fighting for to make long-overdue investments in America‚Äôs future. I‚Äôve also called for a Real Corporate Profits Tax to ensure that giant companies that report billions of dollars in profits don‚Äôt exploit loopholes to pay close to nothing in taxes. President Biden‚Äôs plan includes a version of this policy. I‚Äôve got lots of ways to make big corporations and the ultra-rich pay their fair share for these investments, like raising the top corporate tax rate, stopping tax haven abuse and offshoring, and bolstering the IRS. The President's plan includes all these ideas. And I announced a bill with @RepAndyLevin to use the enormous purchasing power of the US government to kick-start demand for American-made clean energy products and create good jobs. President Biden‚Äôs plan is a good first step toward the goal. My #BuildGreen Act would electrify our public transportation to create jobs, modernize our crumbling infrastructure, and fight the #ClimateCrisis. President Biden‚Äôs proposal has the first round of funding we need to make our plan a reality. I‚Äôve introduced a housing bill to build millions of new housing units, and a bill to take care of our badly-needed public housing repairs. President Biden‚Äôs plan gets us a good part of the way there to create jobs and make housing more affordable. I‚Äôve been sounding the alarm long before COVID about the big, structural investments that we need to make child care part of our basic infrastructure. President Biden‚Äôs plan invests in child care facilities and availability, a good first step on the path to universal care. President Biden‚Äôs #AmericanJobsPlan is crammed full of a lot of good policies that I‚Äôve been fighting for to help working families and our economy. I wanted to highlight just a few: The Remove the Stain Act is a step toward acknowledging and making amends for the shameful history of the Wounded Knee massacre. I'm glad to work with @SenJeffMerkley and @RepKahele to ensure the Medal of Honor is reserved for actions worthy of our highest military honor. https://t.co/fEAyX7rrQH Archegos' meltdown had all the makings of a dangerous situation. Regulators need more than luck to fend off risks to the financial system: we need transparency and strong oversight so the next hedge fund blowup doesn't take the economy down with it. https://t.co/U4mgJ5N2IG The #AmericanRescuePlan delivered $40 billion to keep our child care system from collapsing, but our goal can‚Äôt just be to stabilize an already-broken system. Our proposal for long-term, structural child care investments should be included in the upcoming infrastructure bill. Just like roads and bridges that allow people to get to work, child care is critical infrastructure that makes all other work possible. I‚Äôm working with @RonWyden, @SenTinaSmith, @SenSherrodBrown and @SenBobCasey on a bill for permanent child care funding. https://t.co/yOiXbRNyWu This green procurement bill is a bold, smart way to convert our nation‚Äôs biggest spender to clean energy products, kick-start demand for US-made renewables, and create good jobs. The Biden admin should include it along with the #BuildGreen Act in their infrastructure package. Our bill would:
‚úÖ Establish a grant program for a wide range of American-made clean energy products
‚úÖ Fund bulk purchases for green products to state, local and tribal governments at discounted rates
‚úÖ Help replace the federal vehicle fleet with zero-emission electric vehicles The US government has enormous purchasing power, and we can use it to help fight the #climatecrisis. I have a new bill with @RepAndyLevin to commit $1.5 trillion in federal procurement for American-made clean, renewable, and emission-free energy products. https://t.co/W8T6jqr9IA My #BuildGreen Act with @SenMarkey, @RepAndyLevin, and @RepAOC to convert our country's public transportation to electric will help create good jobs, modernize our crumbling infrastructure, and save the planet. That‚Äôs good for everyone. https://t.co/dd4zaTJgJb Working families in Lynn have been hit especially hard by this public health and economic crisis. I was glad to join @MayorTomMcGee at the @LynnCHC‚Äôs terrific vaccination clinic, and we spoke with LHAND about the housing relief in the #AmericanRescuePlan. https://t.co/aTgXattpTr The @GLFHC is receiving an $8.5 million grant from the #AmericanRescuePlan to support their amazing work across the Merrimack Valley, especially for Latinx families hit hard by COVID. @RepLoriTrahan and I had a great visit to their Methuen vaccination clinic today. https://t.co/YyNvvNwpN9 Watch @SenatorMenendez, @SenSchumer and I explain how we made sure nobody will get stuck with surprise taxes on any cancelled student loans. Let‚Äôs #CancelStudentDebt, Mr. President.  https://t.co/7OvwqgfWw1 Any caregiving legislation should deliver structural reform for universal child care and expanded home and community care. And it should treat caregivers like the pros they are with good pay, health care, paid sick leave, and the right to join a union. https://t.co/zcWYaws0xN For years now, the Republicans have blocked even the most basic gun safety legislation to keep our kids safe.

We just have to want to."" https://t.co/0wDZXLtxRI The #AmericanRescuePlan gives states billions of dollars to help smaller communities and communities of color that have been hardest hit by COVID. I asked @SecYellen to clarify: yes, states can use that money from Congress to ensure that vulnerable communities aren't left behind. https://t.co/K5ZhRifvJz It makes no sense that giant corporations can report huge profits to their shareholders and still pay nothing in federal taxes.

‚úÖ Invest $500B to electrify buses, commuter rail, and other public transportation systems and build out electric charging stations
‚úÖ Create nearly 1M jobs with strong labor protections
‚úÖ Ensure at least 40% of funds help frontline communities Converting our public transportation to electric is one of the best ways we can create jobs, modernize our crumbling infrastructure, and fight the climate crisis.

I strongly agree, @WeDemandJustice: diversity of experience matters on the bench. We don‚Äôt need judges who put a thumb on the scales of justice.

Some people don‚Äôt want some people to vote. For 73 years, United States Air Force Reservists have bravely defended our skies and kept our country safe. Today, we celebrate their service and honor the outstanding Air Force Reserve veterans in our community. #ReserveReady The IRS chief warned that unpaid taxes could exceed $1 trillion dollars a year. That‚Äôs way up from official estimates. The IRS ought to address wealthy Americans purposefully evading their taxes.

Yes, it was inconvenient for many when the naked Emperor was called out for his nudity. But it was true; and pretending otherwise is a convenience we cannot afford. It is the pep rallies at the Federalist Society, the dark money, the soliciting of cases, the blind eye to the right-wing machinery producing those cases, the disregard for conservative principles when they would block the victories, and on and on... The problem, Justice Breyer, is not those who refer to justices by the president or party that appointed them, it is the trail of 80 5-4 partisan decisions by Republican Justices giving victories to big Republican donor interests. If you‚Äôre a fossil fuel company funding Republicans and denying climate change, by all means; if you criticize a Georgia state law suppressing voters, you get this.

Peanuts are the #1 snack nut consumed in the U.S.
Mississippi is a major peanut producer with over 32,000 acres dedicated to peanuts. It is no surprise that this bill has not earned a single Republican vote. 

This is no way to govern, and I strongly oppose this legislation. The bill is full of unnecessary spending that will overheat the economy at a time when infections are dropping nationwide.

The numbers don't lie: going big on relief to help Americans survive this crisis is working. https://t.co/yZ2u9zvX9K The lesson of the Republican tax law is that you can shower corporations with hundreds of billions in handouts and fail to produce a lasting boost to American jobs and investment. https://t.co/UZ5RXurEOp Starting in April, eligible Americans who have lost a loved one to COVID-19 can now get FEMA help to cover funeral costs.

We promised to help families and workers survive this crisis and we‚Äôre about to deliver for the American people. This whole process underscores the need to put a stop to jumping from cliff to cliff. I‚Äôll continue fighting to tie jobless benefits to economic conditions on the ground instead of arbitrary deadlines to ensure Americans have the help they need to pay rent and buy groceries. At every stage, Democrats have fought for the strongest jobless package and Republicans have opposed. Going back to the CARES Act, Republicans‚Äô only goal has been to stonewall relief for Americans. My top priority throughout these negotiations has been securing the strongest possible deal for jobless workers that could pass the Senate.

Transparency is the first step to accountability, which is why I wrote the law requiring the release of this report.

"Biden, Joe",JoeBiden,POTUS,Delaware,Delaware,President," The American Jobs Plan is the largest American jobs investment since World War II. Under the American Jobs Plan, 100% of our nation‚Äôs lead pipes and service lines will be replaced‚Äîso every child in America can turn on the faucet or fountain and drink clean water. 

We cannot delay another minute. Wall Street didn‚Äôt build this country‚Äîthe great American middle class did. This time, when we rebuild the middle class under the American Jobs Plan, we‚Äôre bringing everyone along. Delivering for the American people is what the American Rescue Plan was about. It‚Äôs what the American Jobs Plan is about.

We can do this.
We have to do this.
We will do this. The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-generation investment in America. It will:
‚úÖModernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets
‚úÖRepair 10,000 bridges desperately in need of upgrades 
‚úÖReplace 100% of our nation‚Äôs lead pipes and service lines Millions of Americans lost their jobs last year.

Here‚Äôs the truth: We all do better when we all do well. It‚Äôs time to build our economy from the bottom up‚Äîand the middle out‚Äînot the top down. It matters whether you continue to wear a mask.  
It matters whether you continue to socially distance.  
It matters whether you wash your hands.  

It all matters and can help save lives. The American Rescue Plan means a $7,000 check for a single mom of four. It means more support to safely and quickly reopen schools. It means setting up additional vaccination sites to help America get back to normal. 

What does the American Rescue Plan mean to you? 85% of American households will get direct checks from the American Rescue Plan.

For so many Americans, that means they can pay the rent. That means they can put food on the table.  

Share below what the American Rescue Plan will do for you. A campaign for everyone who‚Äôs been knocked down or counted out.

A campaign that brought Americans together of every race, ethnicity, gender, economic station, and party.

A year ago, the people of South Carolina lifted that campaign on their shoulders.
https://t.co/YN5LeBMLMe Now the real work begins, folks.

My Campaign Advisor Bob Bauer and General Counsel Dana Remus shared their thoughts on how the will of the people prevailed. https://t.co/glyZgv5AtZ Across the country, approximately 14 million Americans have fallen behind on rent and many may soon be at risk of eviction.

In this pandemic, in America, we cannot let people go hungry. We cannot let people get evicted. We cannot watch nurses and educators lose their jobs.

We must act. Science will always be at the forefront of my administration ‚Äî and these world-renowned scientists will ensure everything we do is grounded in science, facts, and the truth. https://t.co/fEbgDMkTDZ My administration will move Heaven and Earth to:

- Allow more people to get vaccinated
- Create more places for them to get vaccinated
- Mobilize more medical teams to get shots in arms
- Increase vaccine supply and get it out the door as soon as possible To Pilar, and the countless other small business owners across the country, know that help is on the way. https://t.co/4mKPjN6rgx Direct cash payments.
Extended unemployment.

Now, the process continues to the Senate‚Äîand I hope they‚Äôll deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation. Ambassador Samantha Power is a world-renowned voice of conscience and moral clarity‚Äîchallenging and rallying the international community to stand up for the dignity and humanity of all people. As USAID Administrator, she'll be a powerful force for principled American engagement. https://t.co/jwseGEsb8c My number one priority is getting people vaccinated as quickly as we can to get our country back on track. https://t.co/JLY1DntIlR It‚Äôs long past time to raise the minimum wage, so hardworking people earn at least $15 an hour. 
 
I hope that Democratic control of the House and Senate will ensure prompt action to get it done. I urge every American to:

- Wear a mask
- Stay socially distanced
- Avoid large indoor gatherings

We can save countless lives if we step up together. Getting America vaccinated will be one of the greatest operational challenges we‚Äôve ever faced, but my administration will spare no effort to get it done.

We‚Äôre going to ensure the vaccine is distributed quickly, equitably, and free of charge to every American. Folks, I just received the second dose of my COVID-19 vaccine ‚Äî and just like the first dose, it was safe, quick, and painless. 

I urge everyone to get vaccinated once it‚Äôs your turn. Because only together can we save lives and beat this virus. https://t.co/w1m8gEh2iL The work of the next four years must be the restoration of democracy and the recovery of respect for the rule of law, and the renewal of a politics that‚Äôs about solving problems ‚Äî not stoking the flames of hate and chaos.

https://t.co/eeZHsafDkq Our economic team members have track records of not only standing up for workers and unions, but spurring innovation, and creating opportunity for small business owners. And like President-elect @JoeBiden and I, they will fight to honor the dignity of work. https://t.co/HYAosPJ4iR What the headline doesn't tell you: this disproportionately affects Black and Latina women who often lack paid sick leave or the ability to work from home.

Expanding economic opportunity has never been more important. https://t.co/DrovmDR7Sq My mother taught me that no matter how you earn a living, whether you‚Äôre a caregiver or truck driver, grocery store clerk or small business owner, every job has inherent value and worth. https://t.co/qjUkMvtquA We are still in the middle of a pandemic: mask up, wash your hands, and maintain social distancing. Black women turned out this week to help elect @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff. But we must do more than thank them‚Äî@JoeBiden and I are committed to addressing issues that disproportionately affect Black women, including pay disparity and maternal mortality."

His matchless voice will never be forgotten. May God comfort his family and all those who loved him. God Bless Rush Limbaugh. And during my service as Governor and Vice President, he was the anchor of Conservatism, giving voice to a movement and fighting for the ideals that make America great. During my years in Conservative talk radio, he was my daily inspiration and the gold standard on the airwaves as he sat behind the golden EIB microphone. During my years among House Conservatives in Congress, he was our greatest champion. Karen and I are among the millions who loved and admired this Good and Great Man. We started as fans, had the privilege to become friends, and we will miss him dearly. For more than 30 years no one did more to educate, inform, inspire, and just plain entertain Americans about the issues of the day than Rush Limbaugh. Rush Limbaugh gave voice to the ideals and values that made this country great, he inspired a generation of American conservatives, and he will be deeply missed. Rush Limbaugh made Conservatives proud and he made Conservatism fun. Today America lost a Giant with the passing of Rush Limbaugh, and Karen and I send our most heartfelt sympathies to Kathryn, his brother David, and the millions of Americans who loved and cherished his incomparable voice. https://t.co/tGlhCiY7g6 https://t.co/lrqeRWxoPP Statement on the Passing of Former Indiana First Lady Susan Bayh https://t.co/2a3K0thjgh https://t.co/2hcji7AshH https://t.co/XvZ0c6rFVv Now more than ever, we need to take the case for freedom, free markets, and traditional values to the rising generation and I look forward to working with the great @yaf team to ensure the torch of freedom shines bright for generations to come.

That‚Äôs Peace through Strength. https://t.co/uiSNxi67aT From this very Fort, selfless patriots like you have been at the heart of the war on terror from the very beginning. And it‚Äôs because of you that we reached the 19th anniversary of that terrible day having had no major terrorist attack on American soil since. Since 9/11 the 10th Mountain has been the most deployed division of the US Army. 10th Mountain brigades have served a combined 46 deployments to Iraq &amp; Afghanistan and one of the first conventional units to deploy to Afghanistan after 9/11 came from Fort Drum. Thank you to the men and women of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, you are the strength and the pride of the American people.

I urge the incoming administration to stay the course, do what we‚Äôve done, stand up to Chinese aggression and trade abuses, stand strong for a free and open Indo-Pacific and put America and our freedom loving allies first. After generations where America &amp; our allies defended the freedom of navigation &amp; the interest of freedom loving nations across the Asia Pacific, today, China is determined to expand Beijing‚Äôs influence across the region through military provocations &amp; debt diplomacy. Thank you to all of the men &amp; women serving our Country in uniform at Naval Air Station Lemoore! The American people are more grateful for your service than you will ever know.

At 24 years old, he inspired an entire generation of American pilots. It was my honor to pay tribute to America‚Äôs Greatest Aviator, General Chuck Yeager.

We grieve the loss of life in these hallowed halls, as well as the injuries suffered by those who defended our Capitol today. Peaceful protest is the right of every American but this attack on our Capitol will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now.
